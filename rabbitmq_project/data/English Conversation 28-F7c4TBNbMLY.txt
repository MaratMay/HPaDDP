B	00:11:42.800	00:11:44.630	but you haven't met my little brother.
B	00:11:44.640	00:11:46.079	this is steve.
J	00:11:46.079	00:11:47.829	i was going to pick you up this morning.
J	00:11:47.839	00:11:49.360	you wouldn't let me.
A	00:11:49.360	00:11:50.399	i'm sorry.
A	00:11:50.399	00:11:52.629	i'd like to find my own way around.
J	00:11:52.639	00:11:55.829	no worries.
J	00:11:57.839	00:11:59.839	maybe another time.
A	00:11:59.839	00:12:01.839	yes, maybe.
B	00:12:01.839	00:12:03.710	come on, let's go outside.

J	00:12:08.720	00:12:11.519	so anne, have you been to an australian home before?
A	00:12:11.519	00:12:12.959	no, never.
A	00:12:12.959	00:12:14.720	it's a beautiful home, sarah.
A	00:12:14.720	00:12:17.829	so big! the rooms are much bigger than at home.
A	00:12:17.839	00:12:19.670	there's more space here.
J	00:12:19.680	00:12:20.880	do you live in a house?
C	00:12:20.880	00:12:23.509	no steve, she lives in an igloo.
A	00:12:23.519	00:12:24.858	actually, no.
A	00:12:24.870	00:12:26.000	we live in an apartment.
A	00:12:26.000	00:12:27.509	most people do.
A	00:12:27.519	00:12:30.870	singapore is much busier than adelaide and more crowded.
J	00:12:30.880	00:12:32.560	yeah, and more exciting.
J	00:12:32.560	00:12:34.470	so boring here.
B	00:12:34.480	00:12:37.839	it's quieter, some people like that.
A	00:12:37.839	00:12:39.829	i don't think it's boring.
C	00:12:39.839	00:12:42.160	adelaide is a very beautiful city.
C	00:12:42.160	00:12:45.839	it's a better place to live than anywhere else i've been.
B	00:12:45.839	00:12:48.470	but you haven't been anywhere.
B	00:12:48.480	00:12:50.959	mark hates travelling.
B	00:12:50.959	00:12:52.949	i love it.
C	00:12:52.959	00:12:55.430	i just don't see the point of it.
A	00:12:57.440	00:12:58.720	what about you, steve?
A	00:12:58.720	00:12:59.839	do you like to travel?
J	00:12:59.839	00:13:08.240	yes yeah,i've been to kuala lumpur and to bali, bali's great!
I	00:13:06.427	00:13:07.987	i've been to the zoo.

A	00:13:10.000	00:13:11.350	i haven't been to the zoo.
A	00:13:11.360	00:13:13.269	i'd love to go to the zoo.
J	00:13:13.279	00:13:14.065	i'll take you.

B	00:13:22.480	00:13:23.950	i'm sorry about my brother.

A	00:13:32.160	00:13:34.160	everyone seems so happy.
B	00:13:34.160	00:13:36.560	anne! what's the matter?
A	00:13:36.560	00:13:38.399	there's something i haven't told you.
B	00:13:38.399	00:13:40.150	oh, what is it?
A	00:13:40.160	00:13:42.560	when i met your brother.
A	00:13:42.560	00:13:45.670	i was thinking about my brother, david.
A	00:13:45.680	00:13:47.839	i haven't seen him for two years.
B	00:13:47.839	00:13:48.750	how come?
A	00:13:49.760	00:13:51.079	he's missing.
A	00:13:52.079	00:13:55.030	one reason i came to australia is to find him.
B	00:13:55.040	00:13:57.000	i'm so sorry!
B	00:13:58.000	00:13:59.990	have you had any luck?
A	00:14:00.000	00:14:01.230	not yet.

A	00:14:08.240	00:14:10.399	i've hired a private investigator.
B	00:14:10.399	00:14:11.639	my goodness.
B	00:14:12.639	00:14:14.839	do you think you'll find him?
A	00:14:14.839	00:14:17.720	perhaps, i don't know.
A	00:14:18.720	00:14:22.150	it's been a long time since david last called.
B	00:14:22.160	00:14:24.639	what do you think's happened to him?
B	00:14:24.639	00:14:26.870	have any idea?
A	00:14:26.880	00:14:27.979	i really don't know.

A	00:14:34.720	00:14:37.120	i can't help thinking the worst.
B	00:14:37.120	00:14:39.829	i'm sure he's all right.
B	00:14:39.839	00:14:41.279	if something bad had happened.
B	00:14:41.279	00:14:43.550	you would have heard.
A	00:14:44.560	00:14:46.040	i guess so.
A	00:14:47.040	00:14:48.224	i suppose you're right.
B	00:14:50.720	00:14:52.420	can i help you find your brother?
A	00:14:53.120	00:14:55.189	you're very kind.

A	00:19:54.480	00:19:56.070	it's cute.

O	00:29:42.240	00:29:47.510	i don't think computer science was the right direction for him.
A	00:29:47.520	00:29:51.029	the investigator, mr babour said you have a letter from david.
O	00:29:51.039	00:29:54.070	of course, yes.

A	00:30:55.679	00:30:57.909	but he says i shouldn't look for him.
O	00:30:57.919	00:31:00.559	yes, well he might have felt that way then.
O	00:31:00.559	00:31:03.830	but a year is a long time.
O	00:31:03.840	00:31:06.600	if i were you, i'd report your brother missing.
A	00:31:07.600	00:31:09.320	should i tell my parents about the letter?
