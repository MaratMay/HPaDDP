A	00:00:01.410	00:00:03.670	what do you usually have for dinner?
B	00:00:03.670	00:00:08.910	I like cooking, I never go out.
A	00:00:08.910	00:00:10.590	why?
B	00:00:10.590	00:00:15.589	it never tastes as good as making it yourself.
A	00:00:15.599	00:00:17.080	what do you make?

B	00:00:40.440	00:00:42.610	how do you pay your bills?

B	00:00:46.290	00:00:47.310	why?
A	00:00:47.310	00:00:50.100	it's more convenient.

A	00:01:04.090	00:01:07.150	I only use them to buy expensive things.
A	00:01:07.150	00:01:10.579	I don't usually do that.
A	00:01:10.589	00:01:13.570	my sister hates doing chores at home.
A	00:01:13.570	00:01:16.379	so she has maid.
B	00:01:16.379	00:01:20.879	does her maid go to her house regularly?

B	00:01:35.100	00:01:38.229	does the maid often cook for her, too?
A	00:01:38.229	00:01:41.650	no, my sister loves to cook.

A	00:01:46.650	00:01:50.580	do you go shopping at the mall a couple of times a month?
B	00:01:50.580	00:01:52.870	no, not really.
B	00:01:52.870	00:01:56.680	I go about once a month, actually,
A	00:01:56.680	00:02:01.039	oh! I go much more often than that.

C	00:02:38.490	00:02:40.170	I never go there.
C	00:02:40.170	00:02:43.570	I don't usually go to Italian restaurants.
