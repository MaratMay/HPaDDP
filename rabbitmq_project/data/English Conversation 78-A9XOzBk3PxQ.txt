A	00:00:00.799	00:00:07.120	yes, i see, i understand.
A	00:00:07.120	00:00:12.150	but it has to be done by Friday, is that possible?
A	00:00:12.160	00:00:13.040	good.
A	00:00:13.040	00:00:13.599	good.
A	00:00:13.599	00:00:16.000	it's very important.
A	00:00:16.000	00:00:17.349	we'll be in touch.
A	00:00:17.359	00:00:18.240	thank you.
A	00:00:18.240	00:00:19.345	goodbye.
A	00:00:26.800	00:00:29.359	mrs lee!
A	00:00:29.359	00:00:31.349	you've got an exceptional cv!
B	00:00:31.359	00:00:33.120	well, thank you, mr stevens.
A	00:00:33.120	00:00:36.640	i don't quite understand why you left spectre.
A	00:00:36.640	00:00:41.520	according to this, you were in a position of considerable responsibility.
B	00:00:41.520	00:00:46.320	that's true, i was very satisfied with my job at the beginning.
B	00:00:46.320	00:00:52.229	i had a very prestigious position and many high-profile projects were sent my way.
B	00:00:52.239	00:01:00.320	however, once spector was taken over by a japanese multinational, things just took a turn to the worse.
B	00:01:00.320	00:01:07.680	my boss was let go, many of my colleagues was transferred and i was relieved of my duties.
B	00:01:07.680	00:01:09.520	and, of course...
B	00:01:09.520	00:01:12.630	well, maybe i shouldn't tell you.
A	00:01:12.640	00:01:14.000	please do!
A	00:01:14.000	00:01:15.830	no reason to be afraid.
B	00:01:15.840	00:01:19.910	well, the truth is i just didn't get along with my new boss.
A	00:01:19.920	00:01:22.080	i appreciate your frankness!
A	00:01:22.080	00:01:27.590	sincerity is one of the main qualities that i look for in my employees.
A	00:01:27.600	00:01:34.149	but tell me, mrs, lee how are your bookkeeping, invoicing, and administrative skills?
B	00:01:34.159	00:01:36.240	excellent, i would say.
B	00:01:36.240	00:01:38.550	but i wanted to speak to you about...
A	00:01:38.560	00:01:42.960	and are you familiar with the publishing market?
B	00:01:42.960	00:01:44.240	uh...
B	00:01:44.240	00:01:47.610	yes, to a certain degree but as i was saying,,,
B	00:01:47.759	00:01:51.109	ever since i was a child i've always been fascinated by...
A	00:01:51.119	00:01:55.109	you can tell me about your dreams at another time, mrs lee.
A	00:01:55.119	00:02:07.109	currently we're busy with our year-end balance sheet, and i need a well-trained assistant to prepare an assessment of our administrative expenses, and to study our assets and liabilities.
A	00:02:07.119	00:02:12.309	you, considering your experiences, appear to be a perfect fit!
B	00:02:12.319	00:02:14.959	well, thank you, mr stevens!
B	00:02:14.959	00:02:22.959	but once this emergency has blown over, i was wondering if perhaps you could take me into consideration as a...
B	00:02:22.959	00:02:24.080	as a...
A	00:02:24.080	00:02:24.800	yes...?
B	00:02:24.800	00:02:27.120	as an author!
B	00:02:27.120	00:02:28.550	i'm quite talented.
B	00:02:28.560	00:02:31.519	my literature professor at university used to encourage me.
A	00:02:31.519	00:02:34.390	this is not a school, mrs lee!
A	00:02:34.400	00:02:39.519	i got in touch with you to speak to you about our marketing office!
A	00:02:39.519	00:02:41.830	that's what i'd like to hire you for!
A	00:02:41.840	00:02:49.200	please, don't be offended, but keep your dreams to yourself for the moment.
A	00:02:49.200	00:02:54.470	as far as books are concerned, we can get started on the bookkeeping immediately!
B	00:02:54.480	00:02:56.959	certainly, but later?
A	00:02:56.959	00:03:08.869	we'll see, we'll see...

B	00:03:08.879	00:03:11.519	excuse me, my name's victoria lee.
B	00:03:11.519	00:03:14.390	today's my first day at work and i'd like to know...
B	00:03:16.251	00:03:17.234	great!
B	00:03:19.840	00:03:21.120	great way to start!
B	00:03:21.120	00:03:22.800	where is everybody?
B	00:03:22.800	00:03:28.080	mr stevens told me i was going to meet my new colleagues and they were going to explain everything.
B	00:03:28.080	00:03:30.710	i wonder if i've come to the wrong department...
C	00:03:30.720	00:03:32.799	ah you must be the new arrival.
C	00:03:33.045	00:03:34.739	pleasure to meet you, i'm rachel.
B	00:03:34.770	00:03:35.722	the pleasure's all mine.
B	00:03:35.599	00:03:37.350	my name's victoria lee.
C	00:03:37.360	00:03:40.470	mr stevens asked me to show you the office and explain everything.
C	00:03:40.480	00:03:41.280	so...
C	00:03:41.280	00:03:44.319	over there is the facts in the photocopier.
C	00:03:44.319	00:03:47.040	this is your desk and computer.
C	00:03:47.040	00:03:48.400	um what else?
C	00:03:48.400	00:03:49.120	oh yes.
C	00:03:49.120	00:03:52.480	you'll find a coffee machine down the hall, but, please remember...
D	00:03:52.480	00:03:55.589	a few breaks and, please, keep them short!
C	00:03:55.599	00:03:59.519	this gentleman is gary reynolds, head of marketing.
B	00:03:59.519	00:04:00.326	how do you do?
B	00:04:00.368	00:04:01.257	i'm victoria.
D	00:04:02.080	00:04:05.920	mr stevens tells me that we're going to be working closely together.
D	00:04:05.920	00:04:11.110	i must say it's quite a pleasure to spend so much time with such a lovely young lady.
B	00:04:11.120	00:04:12.640	happily married woman!
B	00:04:12.640	00:04:15.589	married with a son, as a matter of fact!
C	00:04:15.599	00:04:16.959	well done, victoria!
C	00:04:16.959	00:04:18.720	let him know who's who!
C	00:04:18.720	00:04:24.960	gary's the kind of guy who can't control himself with attractive women!
D	00:04:24.960	00:04:27.590	thank you for the compliment, rachel!
D	00:04:27.600	00:04:32.629	let's get down to work!
D	00:04:32.639	00:04:35.680	here's an analysis of last year's investments.
D	00:04:35.680	00:04:40.469	as you can see we've consistently improved our bottom line in all sectors.
D	00:04:40.479	00:04:44.800	even if, as far as i'm concerned, we need to move more aggressively into the market.
B	00:04:44.800	00:04:46.639	what exactly do you mean?
D	00:04:46.639	00:04:49.670	well improve our e-commerce play, for example.
D	00:04:49.680	00:04:59.120	um let's imagine for a moment that pilgrim were to develop an advanced online catalog that would allow users to purchase directly online.
D	00:04:59.120	00:05:03.680	don't you think that this way we could dramatically cut our distribution costs?
B	00:05:03.680	00:05:06.629	certainly, but what does mr stevens think?
D	00:05:06.639	00:05:09.759	well he's a bit old school in his way of thinking.
D	00:05:09.759	00:05:14.684	according to his world view, we should focus on sales through more traditional channels.
D	00:05:15.196	00:05:18.699	i on the other hand, would be thrilled if you saw things more along my lines.
D	00:05:19.840	00:05:25.110	why don't we develop a realistic marketing strategy that includes possible e-commerce earnings?
D	00:05:25.120	00:05:28.160	uh perhaps, we could convince them together!
B	00:05:28.160	00:05:30.150	i'm afraid i can't at the moment, gary!
B	00:05:30.160	00:05:33.590	i've got to focus on the bookkeeping to begin with.
D	00:05:33.600	00:05:38.550	listen, uh why don't we have a little dinner together, and then continue working at my house?
B	00:05:38.560	00:05:39.360	i'm married.
B	00:05:39.360	00:05:41.240	remember gary?

B	00:05:44.000	00:05:46.720	statistics, accounts, reports.
B	00:05:46.720	00:05:49.189	not much has changed from spector.
B	00:05:49.199	00:05:50.950	and i was hoping for a more creative...
E	00:05:55.840	00:05:56.880	oh hello!
E	00:05:56.880	00:05:58.400	you must be the new hire.
E	00:05:58.400	00:05:59.670	i'm anne baxter.
B	00:05:59.680	00:06:01.280	i'm victoria lee.
B	00:06:01.280	00:06:02.669	i recognize your name...
B	00:06:02.560	00:06:03.670	have we met before?
E	00:06:03.680	00:06:04.880	i don't think so.
E	00:06:04.880	00:06:07.270	or perhaps we met at the red lion pub.
E	00:06:07.280	00:06:09.840	i often go there with my friends.
B	00:06:09.840	00:06:12.070	no it doesn't sound familiar!
B	00:06:12.080	00:06:15.039	actually i have a son so i don't get out much.
B	00:06:15.039	00:06:18.639	but still, i've heard your name before!
B	00:06:18.639	00:06:21.039	just a moment, now i remember!
B	00:06:21.039	00:06:24.390	we met on the telephone when i was still working at spectre.
B	00:06:24.400	00:06:27.830	we both had that problem with our courier fast!
E	00:06:27.840	00:06:29.600	oh yes!
E	00:06:29.600	00:06:31.670	oh yes, i remember now!
E	00:06:31.680	00:06:35.199	you were having problems with a shipment to...
E	00:06:35.199	00:06:36.479	to china!
E	00:06:36.479	00:06:37.680	gosh!
E	00:06:37.680	00:06:39.110	what a coincidence!
E	00:06:39.120	00:06:42.000	well, who would have ever thought we would end up working together!
E	00:06:42.000	00:06:43.360	so, how are things going?
B	00:06:43.360	00:06:45.667	well, it's still too early to say.
B	00:06:45.709	00:06:47.759	today's my first day at work!
E	00:06:47.759	00:06:50.880	well, i presume you've already met gary...
B	00:06:50.880	00:06:51.840	yes, earlier.
B	00:06:51.840	00:06:53.759	we're working on a project together.
E	00:06:53.759	00:06:56.960	and i bet he's already invited you out to dinner!
B	00:06:56.960	00:06:58.230	yes, as a matter of fact!
E	00:06:58.240	00:07:04.155	and he's probably told you that he loves working with charming young girls such as yourself.
B	00:07:04.080	00:07:06.070	yes, and how do you know?
E	00:07:06.080	00:07:08.479	he always uses the same line.
E	00:07:08.479	00:07:10.230	he did the same with me.
E	00:07:10.240	00:07:12.560	how original!
E	00:07:12.560	00:07:14.560	well, i'm pleased that you've joined us here.
E	00:07:14.560	00:07:18.240	and well i hope we'll become great friends.
B	00:07:18.240	00:07:19.840	yes, well, i'm sure we will!
B	00:07:19.840	00:07:21.759	you're very nice...
B	00:07:21.759	00:07:32.150	and, who knows, maybe that telephone call was destiny!

A	00:07:32.160	00:07:35.830	who's in charge of delivery to the blue moon bookshop?
D	00:07:35.840	00:07:36.960	uh annandai.
D	00:07:36.960	00:07:37.919	why?
A	00:07:37.919	00:07:42.800	they've just telephoned complaining that they haven't received anything yet.
E	00:07:42.800	00:07:44.790	well, that's impossible!
E	00:07:44.800	00:07:46.720	i sent the delivery five days ago.
A	00:07:46.720	00:07:50.319	that's just it,i don't understand what could have happened.
A	00:07:50.319	00:07:52.950	the merchandise should have arrived by now.
A	00:07:52.960	00:08:03.830	and call the shipping agents to find out what's up.
E	00:08:03.840	00:08:08.070	hello, am i speaking to fast shipping?
E	00:08:08.080	00:08:10.879	this is anne baxter from pilgrim publishing.

E	00:08:18.282	00:08:22.340	What's? That's impossible! there must be some mistake.
E	00:08:22.479	00:08:23.909	you can't have delivered it!
E	00:08:23.919	00:08:29.670	our client has just telephone saying that they haven't received anything yet!
E	00:08:29.680	00:08:34.389	okay, okay. i'll take a look at the paperwork and get back to you.

A	00:08:41.680	00:08:45.509	rachel, go get the bill of lading?
A	00:08:45.519	00:08:48.293	we need to look into what caused this mistake?
A	00:08:49.040	00:08:53.519	gary are you sure you provided the exact address?
D	00:08:53.519	00:08:54.180	certainly!
D	00:08:54.190	00:08:54.985	i still remember it. 
D	00:08:55.069	00:08:57.824	it's thirty-five lafayette avenue orange.
A	00:08:58.080	00:08:59.920	that's it, all right.
A	00:08:59.920	00:09:01.750	what about the duty?
A	00:09:01.760	00:09:03.519	do you remember paying it?
D	00:09:03.519	00:09:07.795	duty,excuse me mr stevens but we're eu members and not required to pay duty.
D	00:09:07.863	00:09:13.440	merchandise is free to move between the member states and duty is no longer required nor is documentation.
A	00:09:13.440	00:09:15.360	eu?
A	00:09:15.360	00:09:17.829	what does europe have to do with it?
D	00:09:17.839	00:09:20.720	excuse me, but orange is in france, isn't it?
A	00:09:20.720	00:09:22.949	good, god gary!
A	00:09:22.959	00:09:27.839	blue moon is in orange, but not in france.
A	00:09:27.839	00:09:32.959	orange is a city in massachusetts, usa!
A	00:09:32.959	00:09:36.080	call the bookshop immediately!
D	00:09:36.080	00:09:37.068	what an idiot!
D	00:09:37.136	00:09:46.150	that's why i paid less on freight charges and was budgeted!
E	00:09:46.160	00:09:47.802	hello, pilgrim publishing.
E	00:09:47.807	00:09:50.070	this is anne baxter, how may i help you?
B	00:09:50.080	00:09:52.160	hello, this is victoria lee.
B	00:09:52.160	00:09:54.310	i'm calling in regards to the shipment.
B	00:09:54.320	00:09:56.870	i was wondering if you had any news yet?
E	00:09:56.880	00:10:01.030	yes, actually i was just about to call you.
E	00:10:01.040	00:10:05.120	unfortunately, there's been a misunderstanding.
E	00:10:05.120	00:10:07.279	uh but don't worry.
E	00:10:07.279	00:10:09.509	we are taking care of things on our end.
E	00:10:09.519	00:10:11.920	and you should receive the goods very soon!
B	00:10:11.920	00:10:14.240	could you tell me exactly what's happened?
B	00:10:14.240	00:10:16.560	my boss is extremely upset.
B	00:10:16.560	00:10:18.550	the shipping documents were in order.
B	00:10:18.560	00:10:22.150	according to the bill of lading, the supply should have already arrived.
B	00:10:22.160	00:10:26.870	can you explain why the merchandise that is blocked in the custom warehouse?
E	00:10:26.880	00:10:28.560	customs?
E	00:10:28.560	00:10:35.760	oh no, you see, i'm afraid there's been a slight problem in addressing the goods.
E	00:10:35.760	00:10:41.670	and they've been sent to a destination in france instead of massachusetts.
B	00:10:41.680	00:10:45.190	france? massachusetts? what are you talking about?
B	00:10:45.200	00:10:47.350	merchandise was destined for china!
E	00:10:47.360	00:10:48.069	china?
E	00:10:49.980	00:10:55.440	excuse me, um are you the owner of the blue moon in orange massachusetts?
B	00:10:55.440	00:10:57.670	no i'm not!
B	00:10:57.680	00:11:02.230	i work for spectre, we're a multinational sporting goods manufacturer.
B	00:11:02.240	00:11:04.201	i'm speaking with fast shippers, aren't I?
E	00:11:04.240	00:11:05.273	well actually, no!
E	00:11:05.291	00:11:07.200	this is pilgrim publishing!
E	00:11:07.200	00:11:09.829	i'm afraid you've got the wrong number.
E	00:11:09.839	00:11:12.870	but we do have something in common.
E	00:11:12.880	00:11:17.829	we both use the same courier.
B	00:11:17.839	00:11:22.560	life is funny i dial the wrong number and who do i call?
B	00:11:22.560	00:11:24.389	a publishing house!
B	00:11:24.399	00:11:26.320	maybe it's fate!
B	00:11:26.320	00:11:28.470	nice young woman, as well!
B	00:11:28.480	00:11:30.640	what was her name?
B	00:11:30.640	00:11:32.800	anne baxter, that's right.
B	00:11:32.800	00:11:37.030	we use the same couriers and are both having problems with deliveries!
B	00:11:37.040	00:11:39.760	what a strange coincidence!
F	00:11:39.760	00:11:42.967	mrs lee, have you spoken with fast shippers yet?
B	00:11:44.160	00:11:46.480	not yet, the number's always busy!
F	00:11:46.480	00:11:48.389	we have to figure out what's happened.
F	00:11:48.399	00:11:51.910	this delivery delay is costing us a lot of money.
F	00:11:51.920	00:12:02.710	the courier assured us that the merchandise didn't have to pass through customs, that it would have left their warehouse with the customs bill already compiled without any additional customs requirements.
B	00:12:02.720	00:12:03.760	that's right!
B	00:12:03.760	00:12:05.680	considering the shipping costs...
B	00:12:05.680	00:12:15.910	they're so high because they include all international delivery costs such as transit, loading and unloading, assembly, and warehouse storage costs.
F	00:12:15.920	00:12:19.509	just a moment, i've got it!
F	00:12:19.519	00:12:23.750	did you remember to attach the certificate of origin, mrs lee?
B	00:12:23.760	00:12:26.320	the certificate of origin?
B	00:12:26.320	00:12:29.030	i don't really know what that is!
B	00:12:29.040	00:12:31.760	it's never been required for our shipments!
F	00:12:31.760	00:12:39.190	the certificate of origin is that document which states the merchandise's country of origin for customs purposes.
F	00:12:39.200	00:12:47.590	it's absolutely necessary for companies doing business in countries which don't belong to the eu provided upon customs officials request.
F	00:12:47.600	00:12:49.920	and china is one of those countries!
B	00:12:49.920	00:12:52.160	i'm sorry, mrs collins!
B	00:12:52.160	00:12:54.560	i didn't know i swear it!
B	00:12:54.560	00:12:57.760	up until now, i've never taken care of shipments!
F	00:12:57.760	00:13:01.750	this is going to be one very expensive mistake!
F	00:13:01.760	00:13:03.440	oh, by the way...
F	00:13:03.440	00:13:11.590	i'll be taking our losses caused by this delay out of your salary!

G	00:13:11.600	00:13:18.230	oh hi victoria.
G	00:13:18.240	00:13:20.150	why we're until the meeting this morning?
B	00:13:20.160	00:13:21.750	which meeting?
G	00:13:21.760	00:13:35.975	the meeting the mrs.collins called with all the department heads to come to grips with the situation and, i quote: to discuss the means with which we can improve both production and company efficiencies.
B	00:13:36.320	00:13:38.470	no one told me anything!
B	00:13:38.480	00:13:42.639	i bet she did that on purpose my darling boss.
B	00:13:42.639	00:13:46.550	she wanted to get back at me for a mistake i made on a shipment!
B	00:13:46.560	00:13:51.990	she always keeps me out of the loop on all the important developments and makes me do the work of a secretary!
B	00:13:52.000	00:13:53.360	i hate her!
G	00:13:53.360	00:13:55.670	come on, victoria, chin up!
G	00:13:55.680	00:13:57.040	things will get better.
B	00:13:57.040	00:13:59.509	i'm not sure about that, paul.
B	00:13:59.519	00:14:03.509	anyway, tell me: what did you discuss at the meeting?
G	00:14:03.519	00:14:08.639	well, you can imagine the tone the mrs collins used.
G	00:14:08.639	00:14:11.350	she prefers cold and distant.
G	00:14:11.360	00:14:18.069	she urged us all to work even harder to overcome this difficult moment for the company.
B	00:14:18.079	00:14:22.959	according to her, we should be working twenty-four seven three sixty-five.
G	00:14:22.959	00:14:36.079	listen to this: she told the warehouse manager to calculate the efficiency of workers more precisely as they go about their tasks, and, if necessary, to lengthen their hours.
G	00:14:36.079	00:14:44.310	then she invited mr rover the personal director to evaluate the necessity of any new hiring.
G	00:14:44.320	00:14:52.959	she told him that from now on, each and every short-term or long-term plan must first be evaluated and approved by her.
B	00:14:52.959	00:14:54.959	i always said she was a dictator!
G	00:14:54.959	00:14:56.150	yeah!
G	00:14:56.160	00:15:07.600	and she claims that we should be delighted at her flexibility, and the many corporate heads she knows would jar result with a huge personnel cuts to improve the situation.
B	00:15:07.600	00:15:09.430	oh what an understanding woman!
G	00:15:09.440	00:15:12.470	you bet!
G	00:15:12.480	00:15:25.670	then she added the companies need to meet deadlines and to work within strict budget in order to keep clients satisfied and remain competitive in the market.
G	00:15:25.680	00:15:39.189	finally, referring to you she reminded us all the delays and errors in projects are absolutely unacceptable.
G	00:15:39.199	00:15:40.491	what are you doing,victoria? 
G	00:15:40.972	00:15:42.310	are you taking notes?
B	00:15:42.320	00:15:43.440	no!
B	00:15:43.440	00:15:57.269	i'm writing my letter of resignation.

B	00:15:57.279	00:15:58.399	paul!
G	00:15:58.399	00:16:01.269	don't tell me this is true...
G	00:16:01.279	00:16:03.600	are you really gonna leave?
B	00:16:03.600	00:16:04.790	yes, paul.
B	00:16:04.800	00:16:06.639	i just can't stay here.
B	00:16:06.639	00:16:11.990	since mrs collins has arrived, the work climate has become unbearable!
B	00:16:12.000	00:16:17.656	she never misses an opportunity to humiliate me and to assign me the most demeaning tasks.
G	00:16:17.994	00:16:20.240	what are you going to do now?
B	00:16:20.240	00:16:24.480	well, i've got in touch with a number of companies.
B	00:16:24.480	00:16:30.560	this afternoon, for example, i have an interview with a publishing house.
G	00:16:30.560	00:16:31.910	publishing house?
G	00:16:31.920	00:16:33.920	you're not going to become an author, are you?
B	00:16:33.920	00:16:35.110	precisely!
B	00:16:35.120	00:16:37.680	you know it's always been a dream of mine.
B	00:16:37.680	00:16:42.880	i don't think the interview is going to focus on my literary talents...
B	00:16:42.880	00:16:45.920	but, paul, you look awful.
B	00:16:45.920	00:16:48.550	what's the matter?
G	00:16:48.560	00:16:51.749	i'm a bit concerned about things.
G	00:16:51.759	00:16:57.920	we're having a meeting with the major shareholders of spectre to take a look at the balance sheets.
B	00:16:57.920	00:17:00.310	and is that a problem?
G	00:17:00.320	00:17:12.400	well as you know, the year end balance sheets provide an overview of the economical, fiscal and fiduciary effectiveness of our management.
G	00:17:12.400	00:17:22.880	and i certainly hope that scrutinizing the books won't uncover inconvenient discrepancies that could lead to a change over company leadership.
B	00:17:22.880	00:17:26.789	what exactly are you referring to?
G	00:17:26.799	00:17:36.240	as you know, things haven't been rosy lately, even if there has been a slight improvement in share prices during the last quarter.
G	00:17:36.240	00:17:43.360	however, at the same time, the outstanding debts to our suppliers have also increased.
G	00:17:43.360	00:17:48.240	in other words, our revenues don't cover our expenses.
B	00:17:48.240	00:17:51.029	the situation is serious, then!
G	00:17:51.039	00:17:52.559	that's right.
G	00:17:52.559	00:17:57.760	i'm afraid we'll need to resort to additional outside financing.
G	00:17:57.760	00:18:10.870	i've been calculating the various balance sheets entries to understand what's causing our debts and try to develop a plan of attack to get our weak points under control.
G	00:18:10.880	00:18:13.909	the results are anything but encouraging.
G	00:18:13.919	00:18:26.720	as you well know, the solidity and integrity of our financial core assets are indispensable to keeping our production capabilities intact and revenues flowing.
B	00:18:26.720	00:18:30.310	i certainly wouldn't want to be in your shoes at the meeting!
G	00:18:30.320	00:18:31.679	no kidding!
G	00:18:31.679	00:18:34.320	i'm predicting lightning and thunder!
G	00:18:34.320	00:18:37.029	i wish i didn't have to participate!
G	00:18:37.039	00:18:43.440	perhaps, i could come down with a sudden case of flu or something.
G	00:18:43.440	00:18:54.710	how about kidney inflammation accompanied by high fever caused by a highly contagious virus mysteriously present in the company?
G	00:18:54.720	00:19:00.400	you laugh but now that you won't be here i'll have to double the work!
G	00:19:00.400	00:19:09.190	by the way they, don't happen to need someone else at the publishing house you were speaking about?
B	00:19:09.200	00:19:11.760	so you're a secret author as well?
G	00:19:11.760	00:19:15.840	no, but i can do a lot of things.
G	00:19:15.840	00:19:21.760	for example: use a computer, make photocopies, send faxes.
G	00:19:21.760	00:19:24.230	that should be enough, shouldn't it?
G	00:19:24.240	00:19:25.120	what a clown!
B	00:19:25.120	00:19:28.240	i'm gonna miss your jokes, paul!
