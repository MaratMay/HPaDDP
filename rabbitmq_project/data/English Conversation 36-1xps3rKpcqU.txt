B	00:01:56.159	00:02:01.744	i have david doolittle's phone number and his cell phone.

A	00:02:10.640	00:02:12.263	well, i still think it's wrong.
B	00:02:14.400	00:02:15.583	cheryl......
D	00:02:18.160	00:02:19.920	what's going on?
A	00:02:19.920	00:02:23.200	marie just stole david doolittle's cell phone.
E	00:02:23.200	00:02:24.949	david doolittle was here?
B	00:02:24.959	00:02:30.470	i didn't steal it,he left it, and i'm waiting to return it until tonight.
A	00:02:30.480	00:02:34.070	he asked if it was under the table,you said it wasn't.
B	00:02:34.080	00:02:38.080	it wasn't under the table because it was in my pocket.
A	00:02:38.959	00:02:40.409	well, i think that's wrong.
B	00:02:41.120	00:02:44.598	it's not wrong,he'll get his phone back.
A	00:02:45.374	00:02:46.365	what do you two think?
D	00:02:47.524	00:02:49.348	oh,no...
A	00:02:50.720	00:02:52.400	what are you going to do now?
B	00:02:52.400	00:02:58.605	i'm going to call him tonight,tell him i found his phone, and asked him to meet me for dinner.
A	00:02:58.801	00:03:00.419	you're going to ask him to dinner?
B	00:03:00.620	00:03:01.835	sure, why not?
A	00:03:02.420	00:03:04.926	women don't ask men to dinner.
A	00:03:05.552	00:03:06.366	do they?
B	00:03:08.640	00:03:10.000	oh.
B	00:03:10.000	00:03:14.912	don't be so old-fashioned, cheryl. this is the twenty-first century.
B	00:03:15.040	00:03:19.092	women ask men out to dinner all the time, don't they?
A	00:03:22.080	00:03:25.974	well, i still think it's wrong,you should have given him the phone.
D	00:03:26.959	00:03:31.589	cheryl, i have to tell you something.
B	00:03:31.599	00:03:33.280	what?
D	00:03:33.280	00:03:35.670	do you remember when we met?
B	00:03:35.680	00:03:41.814	of course. i was at the park. i'd lost my bag and you helped me find it.
B	00:03:42.720	00:03:44.348	took us two hours.
B	00:03:45.040	00:03:51.548	we talked and talked and i became more interested in bob than in finding the bag.
D	00:03:53.120	00:04:00.122	well, actually... i found your bag in two minutes, but i waited two hours to tell you.
D	00:04:01.360	00:04:08.309	i thought you were the most amazing woman i had ever met and if you had found your bag right away.
D	00:04:08.319	00:04:12.577	you would have left and we wouldn't be here right now.
A	00:04:14.400	00:04:17.318	that is so romantic!
A	00:04:18.560	00:04:20.413	that's why i love this man!
B	00:04:21.652	00:04:25.510	see? if it works for bob, it might work for me.
A	00:04:25.520	00:04:33.160	oh you and david dolittle! fantastic call! call him!

F	00:04:43.840	00:04:46.160	hello, everyone. you remember ms. novak.

F	00:04:47.919	00:04:51.030	ms. novak has just opened an art gallery here.
F	00:04:51.040	00:04:54.390	i've asked her to find some pieces to decorate our office.
F	00:04:54.400	00:04:57.120	she's brought some things for us to look at today.
G	00:04:57.120	00:05:01.340	i have a painting, a sculpture and a photograph that i think you'll like.
G	00:05:03.360	00:05:05.632	here's the painting.
G	00:05:09.550	00:05:13.197	this was painted by a russian artist that i really like.
G	00:05:13.520	00:05:19.433	it's called "sun on the water." the artist was inspired by looking at the sea.
G	00:05:20.720	00:05:22.400	what do you think?
E	00:05:22.400	00:05:25.280	i think i can do that.
A	00:05:25.280	00:05:28.629	it's... fantastic.
B	00:05:28.639	00:05:33.680	how... interesting!
D	00:05:33.680	00:05:37.737	it's... very blue.
G	00:05:37.798	00:05:38.822	yes!
F	00:05:39.759	00:05:40.692	it's gorgeous.
G	00:05:40.767	00:05:54.870	oh, good,here's the sculpture,it was made by a british sculptor,it's called "city of gold."
E	00:05:54.880	00:05:57.120	is it really gold?
G	00:05:57.120	00:06:04.800	no, it's made of wood,it was painted gold,what do you think?
A	00:06:04.800	00:06:07.600	it's... cool.
D	00:06:07.600	00:06:14.150	mr. evans, i think it would look good in your office.
B	00:06:14.639	00:06:18.790	i prefer the painting.
F	00:06:18.800	00:06:21.280	i'm fascinated by it!
G	00:06:21.280	00:06:26.514	good, and here's the photograph.
G	00:06:30.639	00:06:36.390	it's called "winter." it was photographed in paris.
E	00:06:36.400	00:06:38.319	there's nothing there.
G	00:06:38.319	00:06:43.110	it's a photograph of snow in a park.
F	00:06:43.120	00:06:46.160	maybe i should buy them all, what do you think?
A	00:06:46.160	00:06:48.270	great!
G	00:06:48.270	00:06:55.280	excellent!
E	00:06:55.280	00:06:58.550	hey, look. i'm an artist.
E	00:06:58.560	00:07:11.510	here's my latest work, it's called "office wall." it was inspired by looking at the walls of the office.
G	00:07:11.520	00:07:13.360	are you a photographer?
E	00:07:13.360	00:07:19.350	yes, well, no, i... i take a lot of pictures.
G	00:07:19.360	00:07:31.670	hmm. i'm not so crazy about that one but i do like what you've done here.
G	00:07:32.560	00:07:35.589	i'm very moved by it, actually.
G	00:07:35.599	00:07:42.160	it's a fascinating mixture of eastern and western traditions you have talent.
E	00:07:42.160	00:07:43.919	i do?
G	00:07:43.919	00:07:46.469	i think i could sell this.
E	00:07:46.479	00:07:48.479	really?
G	00:07:48.479	00:07:50.150	it's very good.
E	00:07:50.160	00:07:53.830	i'm crazy about photography.
G	00:07:53.840	00:07:56.479	well do you have any more of your work here?
E	00:07:56.479	00:08:00.790	uh, no.
G	00:08:00.800	00:08:08.400	here's my card,why don't you bring me some pieces on Friday?
E	00:08:08.400	00:08:10.840	ok.

E	00:08:11.130	00:08:12.940	bye-bye.
A	00:08:24.840	00:08:29.520	so... where are we going to put this thing?
E	00:08:29.520	00:08:31.270	hang it by my desk.
A	00:08:31.270	00:08:32.479	really?
E	00:08:32.479	00:08:38.159	yeah. as an artist, i'm really starting to like it.
E	00:08:38.159	00:08:43.989	as a matter of fact, i think it's... one of the most interesting works i've ever seen.

B	00:09:02.399	00:09:03.898	bob, can you help me with something?
D	00:09:03.921	00:09:04.630	sure.
B	00:09:04.640	00:09:07.509	i'm trying to print a file but the printer won't work.
D	00:09:07.519	00:09:09.519	push the green button on the printer.
B	00:09:09.519	00:09:10.310	why?
D	00:09:10.320	00:09:13.519	to turn it on. it won't print unless it's on.
B	00:09:13.519	00:09:18.550	oh, right. silly me, thank you.
E	00:09:18.560	00:09:22.070	hey, bob. my laptop crashed and i can't get it to do anything.

A	00:09:52.959	00:09:53.350	why?
D	00:09:53.360	00:09:56.247	to clean the computer and stop the virus.

D	00:10:38.959	00:10:41.279	hey, mr. evans?
F	00:10:41.279	00:10:41.990	yes?
D	00:10:42.000	00:10:44.640	you asked me to build a website for the company.
F	00:10:44.640	00:10:45.990	oh, yes. how's it coming along?
D	00:10:46.000	00:10:49.200	well, sir i i think i need some new technology.
F	00:10:49.200	00:10:50.160	what do you need?
D	00:10:50.160	00:10:53.190	a new scanner.
F	00:10:53.200	00:10:54.240	what's that?
D	00:10:54.240	00:11:00.069	it's a scanner, sir. but it's not nearly as good.
D	00:11:00.069	00:11:00.959	as this one.
D	00:11:00.959	00:11:04.470	this one would give us much better photos.
F	00:11:04.480	00:11:05.360	okay.
D	00:11:05.360	00:11:08.710	and a digital camera would be good.
F	00:11:08.720	00:11:10.079	what's that?
D	00:11:10.079	00:11:15.021	it's not a digital camera,sir,it won't take pictures as easily as this one.
F	00:11:18.079	00:11:18.880	okay.
D	00:11:18.880	00:11:23.750	and also a new laptop.
D	00:11:23.760	00:11:28.310	it's not as fast as this one.
F	00:11:28.320	00:11:29.519	i see.
F	00:11:29.519	00:11:30.800	anything else?
D	00:11:30.800	00:11:37.350	a new dvd drive and i could also use a new joystick.
F	00:11:37.360	00:11:38.720	a joystick?
F	00:11:38.720	00:11:43.030	isn't that for computer games?
D	00:11:43.040	00:11:46.710	well, i don't really need the joystick.
F	00:11:46.720	00:11:55.279	what's all this gonna cost me? what?
D	00:11:55.519	00:12:00.629	well, actually we could do without the dvd drive...
D	00:12:00.639	00:12:09.200	and the laptop... and the camera... and the scanner.
F	00:12:09.200	00:12:10.129	great!

A	00:12:25.760	00:12:29.910	what do you think about this color?

A	00:12:31.519	00:12:34.230	it's tomato red.
A	00:12:34.240	00:12:38.870	how does this color make you feel?
E	00:12:38.880	00:12:40.399	happy.
B	00:12:40.399	00:12:41.910	sad.
D	00:12:41.920	00:12:43.279	tired.
D	00:12:43.279	00:12:46.949	i don't feel like looking at any more colors.
A	00:12:46.959	00:12:50.150	quit complaining.
A	00:12:50.160	00:12:53.990	how about this one?
E	00:12:54.000	00:12:56.560	happy.
B	00:12:56.560	00:12:57.590	sad.
D	00:12:57.600	00:13:01.110	awful. i can't stand looking at it.
D	00:13:01.120	00:13:04.710	do you plan to do this all night?
A	00:13:04.720	00:13:06.240	this one?
A	00:13:06.240	00:13:11.990	be sure to look carefully.
B	00:13:12.000	00:13:12.800	sad.

A	00:13:17.760	00:13:18.959	nervous about what?
D	00:13:18.959	00:13:23.190	i'm nervous you're gonna paint the whole wall that color.
A	00:13:23.200	00:13:24.639	it's my apartment, bob.
D	00:13:24.639	00:13:30.710	yeah, but we come here a lot,can we discuss leaving the walls just like this?
A	00:13:30.720	00:13:34.470	i'm tired of looking at yellow walls.
D	00:13:34.480	00:13:39.430	fine. can you at least choose a color we'll all be excited about?
A	00:13:39.440	00:13:42.000	there is no color you all like.
A	00:13:42.000	00:13:44.310	paul's feeling happy about everything.
A	00:13:44.320	00:13:47.040	marie's feeling sad about everything.
A	00:13:47.040	00:13:49.760	and you just seem to hate color, don't you bob?
D	00:13:49.760	00:13:54.800	i love color, just not those colors.
A	00:13:54.800	00:13:55.680	okay.
A	00:13:55.680	00:14:02.310	then why don't you find a color that everybody likes?
D	00:14:02.320	00:14:05.040	what do you think of this color?
E	00:14:05.040	00:14:07.519	i like it.

A	00:14:11.519	00:14:15.509	i'm not painting the walls the same color as my sofa.
A	00:14:15.519	00:14:17.839	the whole room would be green.
D	00:14:17.839	00:14:20.230	you could change the color of the sofa.
A	00:14:20.240	00:14:22.720	to what?
D	00:14:22.720	00:14:35.189	the color of the walls would be a nice color.

B	00:15:50.480	00:15:51.749	i can't do that.
B	00:15:51.759	00:15:53.759	it's not in my nature.
E	00:15:53.759	00:15:57.360	how do you know? just try.
