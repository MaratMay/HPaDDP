B	00:13:23.539	00:13:24.578	and of course.
D	00:13:25.116	00:13:30.268	you should try to meet with five to ten customers every week.
B	00:13:30.877	00:13:31.578	why?
D	00:13:32.199	00:13:34.490	that is our target for our sales staff.

D	00:13:48.069	00:13:54.911	we do have goals and targets for our sales stuff but you won't need to worry about that until after your training.
B	00:13:55.215	00:13:56.025	oh!
B	00:13:56.116	00:13:58.281	how long will my training be!
D	00:13:58.828	00:14:01.139	it depends on how quickly you learn.
B	00:14:01.861	00:14:03.192	oh no.
D	00:14:03.467	00:14:04.064	what?
B	00:14:04.589	00:14:11.640	if my training time depends on how quickly I learn I could be training for twenty years.
D	00:14:14.139	00:14:14.760	okay.
D	00:14:15.144	00:14:18.878	usually our employees train for six months.
B	00:14:19.704	00:14:21.310	that sounds like enough time.
