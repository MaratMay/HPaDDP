A	00:00:06.799	00:00:11.200	jack! jack, i was waiting for you.
A	00:00:11.200	00:00:12.950	have you got a minute?
B	00:00:12.960	00:00:14.067	sure, edward!
B	00:00:13.934	00:00:14.689	what's up?
B	00:00:14.618	00:00:16.729	Do you want put some muscles in your film?
A	00:00:16.560	00:00:18.800	oh, jack, you're quite a joker!
A	00:00:18.800	00:00:20.480	i need some advice....
A	00:00:20.480	00:00:23.509	about a rather delicate matter...
A	00:00:23.519	00:00:25.760	well, it's about women.
B	00:00:25.760	00:00:28.322	oh, well, then you've come to the right person.
B	00:00:28.240	00:00:32.790	when it comes to women, in all modesty, i'm sort of an expert.
B	00:00:32.800	00:00:35.680	go ahead, shoot! but make it fast, i have to get to the gym.
A	00:00:35.680	00:00:38.227	oh, well, don' worry, it's like this.
A	00:00:39.040	00:00:45.190	if a woman lets you mysteriously know that she's keen on you.
A	00:00:45.200	00:00:50.009	and if you didn't expect it, but then you find that you don't mind the gesture...
A	00:00:49.933	00:00:53.813	in fact, because of these you find that you are becoming fond of her.
A	00:00:54.239	00:00:57.762	and if she acts as if nothing has happened...
B	00:00:57.787	00:00:59.338	wow,wo,wo,what edward?
B	00:00:59.440	00:01:00.628	what are you getting at?
B	00:01:00.634	00:01:01.781	i don't understand!
B	00:01:02.626	00:01:04.960	it is this a new idea for a film?
B	00:01:04.960	00:01:06.390	because if it is.
B	00:01:06.400	00:01:10.710	you should think about rewriting this script,it seems very convoluted to me.
A	00:01:10.720	00:01:13.381	jack, stop joking it's a serious matter!
A	00:01:13.280	00:01:15.184	i i just don't know how to behave...
A	00:01:15.210	00:01:18.321	i i can't stand this situation?
B	00:01:20.137	00:01:20.560	well.
B	00:01:23.280	00:01:25.895	okay! Let's to this the top.
B	00:01:27.680	00:01:34.390	so, a woman goes for you, however, she doesn't do it openly.
B	00:01:34.400	00:01:38.720	but then she pretends as if nothing has happened.
B	00:01:38.720	00:01:44.310	and as far as i can tell, you don't dislike the idea.
B	00:01:44.379	00:01:45.109	have i got it?
A	00:01:45.119	00:01:47.301	exactly! what should i do?
B	00:01:48.640	00:01:49.739	well, the fact...
B	00:01:50.720	00:01:57.520	her behavior leads me to believe that she's fond of games.
B	00:01:57.520	00:02:03.438	so, use that,play the mysterious man.
B	00:02:04.027	00:02:07.040	and then, surprise her with something special.
B	00:02:07.040	00:02:10.710	you know, like... take her out to dinner or...
B	00:02:10.720	00:02:13.680	write her a poem or...
B	00:02:13.680	00:02:15.760	send her some red roses.
B	00:02:15.760	00:02:17.920	women really go for that kind of thing!
A	00:02:17.920	00:02:22.667	really, I got an idea.

A	00:02:32.319	00:02:38.309	great, this spot should work well!
A	00:02:38.319	00:02:41.040	maybe here would be better!
A	00:02:41.040	00:02:42.758	and i'll put the card.
A	00:02:44.425	00:02:44.936	here.
A	00:02:45.864	00:02:46.976	next to this!
A	00:02:50.080	00:02:51.928	Let's give it a quick once over again...
A	00:02:57.840	00:03:03.040	anne, i should have done this long ago!
A	00:03:03.040	00:03:07.509	now, i can't wait any longer...
A	00:03:07.519	00:03:12.550	listen to my poetry written especially for you...
A	00:03:12.560	00:03:34.309	you are perfume, the color of all flowers, the bread and scent of the sea, the warming strength of the sun, you, the shining star that lights my life.
A	00:03:34.319	00:03:37.990	who knows if she'll like it...
A	00:03:38.000	00:03:40.879	what about these roses?
A	00:03:40.879	00:03:43.360	will she like them?
A	00:03:43.360	00:03:46.159	what if she makes fun of me?
A	00:03:46.159	00:03:51.350	perhaps i shouldn't have listened to jack! but of course, of course...
A	00:03:51.360	00:03:55.830	it makes no sense to go on as if nothing has happened.
A	00:03:55.840	00:03:58.906	somebody has to take the first step!
A	00:04:03.280	00:04:10.000	i'll await you tomorrow night here in the living room.
A	00:04:10.000	00:04:12.480	when everyone is asleep...
A	00:04:12.480	00:04:18.479	we'll be able to be alone, finally alone.
A	00:04:18.479	00:04:24.950	okay, that is done. there is nothing more to do now but wait!
A	00:04:24.960	00:04:27.360	Anne'll be home soon...
A	00:04:27.360	00:04:30.635	thank god alice won't be here at least for two hours.
A	00:04:30.479	00:04:34.950	and jack is at the gym,yes, I calculate everything perfectly!
A	00:04:34.960	00:04:39.428	now it's time for me to leave as well, i don't want him to see me here...
A	00:04:40.560	00:04:41.423	here she is.
A	00:04:42.800	00:04:44.019	it's time to go!
A	00:04:48.240	00:04:51.590	excellent, great edward...
A	00:04:51.600	00:04:54.571	the moment of truth approaches!
A	00:04:56.479	00:04:59.427	they'll never call me and anateur to her again!
C	00:05:00.560	00:05:02.479	right, fine.
C	00:05:02.479	00:05:05.520	bye-bye! where's the door open!
C	00:05:05.520	00:05:07.083	Allowing cats come in!
C	00:05:10.880	00:05:12.489	what are these?
C	00:05:13.440	00:05:14.468	for me?
C	00:05:16.268	00:05:17.640	oh, beautiful!
C	00:05:18.639	00:05:20.078	i wonder who sent them.
C	00:05:24.560	00:05:28.841	oh what poetry! who could have written it?
C	00:05:34.080	00:05:36.287	no no. Anne...
C	00:05:38.080	00:05:39.600	what are you thinking?
C	00:05:39.600	00:05:40.504	don't be silly.
C	00:05:40.400	00:05:42.122	it can't have been jack.
C	00:05:44.560	00:05:46.560	oh my god!
C	00:05:46.720	00:05:52.374	then again, he's the only person i can imagine who would have written such lovely poetry!
C	00:05:54.240	00:05:55.840	oh my god...
C	00:05:55.840	00:05:57.581	oh, what if it were jack?
C	00:05:59.919	00:06:02.197	now that sharon is out of the picture...
C	00:06:06.000	00:06:08.970	Who would has ever thought.... That one day...
C	00:06:15.520	00:06:16.825	oh, jack!

D	00:06:21.280	00:06:22.160	hi anne.
C	00:06:22.160	00:06:23.840	hi alice.
D	00:06:23.840	00:06:27.360	my! aren't we feeling chirpy today?
C	00:06:27.360	00:06:30.880	yes, we are feeling chirpy!
C	00:06:30.880	00:06:36.880	i've just received a mysterious and completely unexpected surprise!
D	00:06:36.880	00:06:38.400	so... what is it?
D	00:06:38.400	00:06:41.600	what's all the suspense for?
C	00:06:41.600	00:06:43.000	i'm sorry alice.
C	00:06:44.000	00:06:46.178	i'd like to keep it a secret for the time being!
C	00:06:48.080	00:06:51.520	there's something i have to check up on first.
C	00:06:51.520	00:06:53.318	but don't worry, i'll tell you soon enough!
C	00:06:55.280	00:07:01.360	now, why don't you tell me how's it going with eduard?
C	00:07:01.360	00:07:05.599	by the look on your face i would guess things aren't going very well!
D	00:07:05.599	00:07:10.950	you said it! a complete and utter disaster!
D	00:07:10.960	00:07:14.870	i should never have written that card!
D	00:07:14.880	00:07:15.680	why?
D	00:07:15.680	00:07:17.909	what's the matter?
D	00:07:17.919	00:07:19.520	that's the problem!
D	00:07:19.520	00:07:21.830	nothing has happened!
D	00:07:21.840	00:07:25.360	eduard acts as if he'd never read that card!
D	00:07:25.360	00:07:27.360	and yet i know he read it!
D	00:07:27.360	00:07:30.720	i'm absolutely certain!
C	00:07:30.720	00:07:32.479	why are you so sure?
D	00:07:32.479	00:07:37.199	well, he told me in no uncertain terms.
D	00:07:37.199	00:07:39.599	i fished around, vaguely.
D	00:07:39.599	00:07:48.550	and he admitted that something strange had happened. and he also said that he was very pleased and then nothing.
D	00:07:48.560	00:07:52.309	no words, no actions.
D	00:07:52.319	00:07:56.309	at this point, i think he was referring to something else entirely!
D	00:07:56.319	00:08:03.280	or else, i just have to accept the fact that... he isn't interested in me!
C	00:08:03.280	00:08:11.919	oh, don't get depressed, alice! if you want my opinion, i think you should have told him in person.
C	00:08:11.919	00:08:16.160	face to face is always better than playing games.
C	00:08:16.160	00:08:18.239	anyway, you've still got time.
C	00:08:20.800	00:08:25.502	why don't you sit down and have an earnest word with him?
D	00:08:26.080	00:08:30.240	no way! to be embarrassed further?
D	00:08:30.240	00:08:34.800	anyway, there's something fishy about this whole story!
D	00:08:34.800	00:08:38.560	either edward is acting like a complete fool.
D	00:08:38.560	00:08:44.310	or else he hasn't truly understood what i feel for him.
D	00:08:44.320	00:08:48.310	oh i need some clarity.
D	00:08:48.320	00:08:54.540	from now on i'm going to scrutinize his every move!

A	00:09:03.120	00:09:04.640	hi,Anne?
A	00:09:04.640	00:09:07.360	i'm so happy you have accepted my invitation.
C	00:09:07.360	00:09:09.200	what a strange voice you have!
C	00:09:09.200	00:09:11.176	i almost wouldn't have recognized you.
A	00:09:11.200	00:09:12.240	it's the thrill!
A	00:09:12.240	00:09:15.180	you can't imagine how i've longed for this moment!
C	00:09:15.164	00:09:21.642	oh, really. you don't say... to be truthful, i'm rather emotional myself.
A	00:09:21.440	00:09:22.870	oh, i'm glad you feel that way!
C	00:09:22.880	00:09:24.320	slow down boy...
C	00:09:24.320	00:09:26.312	i really don't want to wake the others.
A	00:09:26.207	00:09:27.951	or the others never mind.
A	00:09:27.920	00:09:30.080	who cares if they find out...
C	00:09:30.080	00:09:32.710	actually, i'd rather they didn't...
C	00:09:32.720	00:09:35.907	you know how I am... I'm shy and reserved.
A	00:09:35.839	00:09:37.190	oh, what a pity!
A	00:09:37.200	00:09:43.040	i know... and that's why i'm crazy about you...
A	00:09:43.040	00:09:49.600	reserved with the others, but you are a tiger when it comes to what you want!
C	00:09:49.600	00:09:50.800	come again?
A	00:09:50.800	00:09:55.279	ah, you know exactly what i'm speaking about!
C	00:09:55.279	00:09:56.824	let's light a candle.
C	00:09:57.921	00:09:59.782	i want to see your face...
C	00:10:18.062	00:10:18.771	edwards?
C	00:10:18.842	00:10:20.179	what are you doing here?
A	00:10:20.352	00:10:23.101	anne it's me... don't worry!
A	00:10:24.871	00:10:26.880	our date... you don't remember?
A	00:10:28.560	00:10:29.920	you are a little nervous...
A	00:10:29.920	00:10:30.900	come here, baby.
C	00:10:31.032	00:10:32.552	oh! let go of me!
C	00:10:32.861	00:10:34.520	and don't dare touch me!
A	00:10:34.880	00:10:37.096	you should be ashamed of yourself!

D	00:10:41.920	00:10:45.030	hey, what's going on in here?
D	00:10:45.040	00:10:47.541	Edward? Anne!

D	00:10:54.560	00:10:57.110	what an idiot i was to confide in you!
C	00:10:57.120	00:10:58.800	no really, alice!
C	00:10:58.800	00:11:00.389	it's not like you think!
D	00:11:00.399	00:11:02.302	and what am i supposed to think then?
D	00:11:02.160	00:11:04.310	it seems pretty clear to me!
C	00:11:04.320	00:11:06.079	no, no really!
C	00:11:06.079	00:11:07.990	let me explain!
C	00:11:08.000	00:11:08.880	i thought it would be...
C	00:11:08.880	00:11:10.800	i thought it would be jack!
A	00:11:10.800	00:11:12.959	what does jack have to do with it?
A	00:11:12.959	00:11:15.990	why did you leave me this note in my napkin the other day?
D	00:11:16.000	00:11:17.040	edward!

D	00:13:12.000	00:13:14.310	horrible mess!
D	00:13:14.320	00:13:16.381	all began with a misunderstanding.
B	00:13:16.240	00:13:18.069	Now, i'm all ears.
B	00:13:18.079	00:13:19.609	go on, alice! do tell!

B	00:13:26.160	00:13:27.839	i'd like to have a word.
C	00:13:27.839	00:13:30.389	you've probably already heard the sordid story.
B	00:13:30.399	00:13:31.600	yes!
B	00:13:31.600	00:13:32.421	listen Anne.

C	00:13:33.920	00:13:36.550	probably had a good laugh on my behalf!
C	00:13:36.560	00:13:40.628	now, that said, i prefer no further comments on the story!
B	00:13:43.120	00:13:45.545	it is not my intention to make fun of you, Anne,isn't it?
B	00:13:46.160	00:13:49.269	although i must admit the whole misunderstanding was rather amusing!
C	00:13:49.279	00:13:52.240	great! now, pretty please...
C	00:13:52.240	00:13:53.981	let's not talk about it anymore!
B	00:13:55.519	00:13:57.388	i would like to have a word about it.
B	00:13:59.519	00:14:02.629	what i'm about to say is be sure to surprise you.
C	00:14:02.639	00:14:04.931	nothing's bound to surprise me anymore, jack!
C	00:14:06.560	00:14:10.949	anyway, listen: don't worry. you don't have to explain!
C	00:14:10.959	00:14:12.480	i know how things are.
C	00:14:12.480	00:14:13.839	i know that you like me.
C	00:14:13.839	00:14:15.509	but just as a friend...
C	00:14:15.519	00:14:16.320	a friend that...
C	00:14:16.320	00:14:17.839	as well maybe,
C	00:14:17.839	00:14:19.472	if we met at some other time.
B	00:14:19.967	00:14:20.962	anne excuse me.
C	00:14:20.800	00:14:22.915	things would have gone differently and then.
C	00:14:22.720	00:14:24.389	well perhaps.
C	00:14:24.399	00:14:25.360	blah blah blah blah!
C	00:14:25.360	00:14:26.399	blah blah blah!
B	00:14:26.399	00:14:29.586	anne, can i speak for one minute, please?
C	00:14:33.440	00:14:37.360	yes. Certainly,jack.
B	00:14:37.000	00:14:37.808	Thank you.
C	00:14:37.854	00:14:39.279	go right ahead.
B	00:14:39.279	00:14:39.889	now...
B	00:14:41.199	00:14:43.440	you know how.
B	00:14:43.440	00:14:45.680	how i suffered about sharon.
B	00:14:45.680	00:14:46.428	and.
B	00:14:47.760	00:14:48.830	after her i.
B	00:14:49.760	00:14:52.389	i didn't think i'd ever feel anything about another woman.
B	00:14:54.399	00:14:56.079	but then.
B	00:14:56.079	00:14:58.480	you came back from your holiday and.
B	00:14:58.480	00:15:00.720	and i started to feel better.
B	00:15:00.720	00:15:02.470	i didn't think about sharing so much.
C	00:15:02.480	00:15:03.902	what are you getting at, jack?
B	00:15:05.519	00:15:07.680	anne, it was.
B	00:15:07.680	00:15:12.959	it was because of you that that i managed to forget about shannon!
C	00:15:12.959	00:15:15.898	well, that's what friends are for, nest pas?
B	00:15:17.040	00:15:18.240	you really don't get it, do you?
C	00:15:18.240	00:15:19.692	get what, jack?
B	00:15:24.959	00:15:26.333	anne. I'm trying to tell you that.
B	00:15:28.160	00:15:30.720	i'm in love with you,I.
B	00:15:30.959	00:15:33.120	i didn't wanna believe it at first, i.
B	00:15:33.120	00:15:38.710	i thought i was attracted to you because i felt so alone in the world.
B	00:15:38.720	00:15:41.040	but then this feeling grew and.
B	00:15:41.040	00:15:42.981	and when alice told me about edward.
B	00:15:43.297	00:15:45.832	i realized it should have been me to bring you those flowers!
C	00:15:45.760	00:15:48.132	jack, if this is some kind of a joke, it's not very amusing!
B	00:15:48.079	00:15:49.040	no, no, no! no,
B	00:15:49.040	00:15:49.881	it's the truth!
B	00:15:49.912	00:15:50.631	i swear.
B	00:15:55.033	00:15:56.389	we were made for each other.
B	00:16:04.000	00:16:06.079	i should have realized that sooner.
B	00:16:06.079	00:16:06.959	i'm sorry.
C	00:16:07.064	00:16:07.850	well jack!

B	00:16:20.000	00:16:23.921	so, edward, are you going to explain why you called us all here today?
B	00:16:24.320	00:16:25.519	what's so urgent?
A	00:16:25.519	00:16:30.629	well, listen: something marvelous has happened, to say the least!
D	00:16:30.639	00:16:34.652	i must say i'm a little unsure about what you term marvelous!
A	00:16:34.160	00:16:36.880	let's put aside our differences, alice.
A	00:16:36.880	00:16:38.921	we should all be happy today!
