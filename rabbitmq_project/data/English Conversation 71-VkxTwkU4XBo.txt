A	00:00:05.580	00:00:06.349	hi jack.
A	00:00:06.867	00:00:08.153	is anne home?
B	00:00:08.187	00:00:09.623	no, she hasn't arrived yet.
B	00:00:10.240	00:00:12.080	i've been waiting for her for over an hour.
B	00:00:12.080	00:00:13.129	i think she's been shopping...
B	00:00:17.025	00:00:18.344	what's the matter?
B	00:00:19.600	00:00:21.050	you don't look too well.
A	00:00:23.760	00:00:26.049	nothing, really...
B	00:00:29.599	00:00:31.129	don't lie to me...
B	00:00:31.679	00:00:33.220	i've known you for  ten years.
A	00:00:34.600	00:00:35.578	listen, jack.
A	00:00:35.586	00:00:35.812	i...
A	00:00:36.079	00:00:37.990	i really don't wanna speak about it.
A	00:00:38.000	00:00:39.000	okay?
B	00:00:39.680	00:00:41.109	no, it's not okay!
B	00:00:42.719	00:00:47.089	we have to speak about the situation and clear the air once and for all!
B	00:00:48.399	00:00:50.160	i've been thinking about us a lot...
B	00:00:53.546	00:00:54.900	i've been thinking about us so much!
B	00:00:54.900	00:00:55.088	i...
B	00:00:55.856	00:00:57.652	i haven't slept well in nights!
A	00:01:00.079	00:01:02.110	what have you been thinking, jack?
B	00:01:03.120	00:01:04.180	about us!
B	00:01:05.680	00:01:07.330	you're leaving for japan...
B	00:01:09.193	00:01:12.868	i've told you before and i'll tell you again, sharon: it's crazy!...
B	00:01:13.680	00:01:15.920	you can't leave now when...
B	00:01:16.114	00:01:17.880	when we know how we feel!
A	00:01:19.040	00:01:19.520	jack...
A	00:01:19.520	00:01:21.600	you're repeating yourself.
B	00:01:21.719	00:01:22.492	that's right!
B	00:01:23.836	00:01:27.850	and i'll continue repeating myself until you accept the truth.
B	00:01:31.439	00:01:33.000	we're made for each other!
A	00:01:34.479	00:01:35.360	stop it!
A	00:01:35.360	00:01:37.000	you're embarrassing me!
B	00:01:38.880	00:01:47.950	sharon listen, i haven't stopped loving you and i know you feel the same about me...
A	00:01:49.360	00:01:50.560	that's it!
A	00:01:50.560	00:01:53.030	i said stop it and i meant it!
A	00:01:54.240	00:01:56.169	look, you've made me cry!
A	00:01:58.479	00:02:01.159	and anyhow, how do our feelings change anything?
B	00:02:02.263	00:02:04.435	how do they change anything?!
B	00:02:04.815	00:02:06.573	they change everything!
B	00:02:09.119	00:02:13.050	you must tell peter immediately about everything.
B	00:02:15.440	00:02:17.000	tell him you won't go!
B	00:02:22.879	00:02:24.229	i'm so happy!
B	00:02:26.239	00:02:28.110	i knew you felt the same way about me!
C	00:02:32.720	00:02:35.299	hey, is anyone in there?
A	00:02:35.599	00:02:37.100	oh my god, it's peter...
A	00:02:37.200	00:02:39.040	he, he can't see me like this!
B	00:02:39.040	00:02:40.179	stay calm...
B	00:02:40.879	00:02:43.090	maybe it's time we tell him everything.
C	00:02:45.860	00:02:46.474	hey jack...
C	00:02:47.982	00:02:48.700	sharon?!
C	00:02:50.689	00:02:51.758	what are you doing here?
C	00:02:52.480	00:02:54.030	i've been looking for you for half an hour...
C	00:02:57.040	00:02:58.040	hey, what's the matter?
C	00:02:59.040	00:03:00.129	you've been crying!
C	00:03:02.239	00:03:05.270	are you going to explain to me what's going on or not?
B	00:03:05.280	00:03:06.640	peter, listen, calm down...
C	00:03:06.640	00:03:08.070	i'm not gonna calm down!
C	00:03:08.624	00:03:10.816	i want answers, and i want them now!
D	00:03:10.896	00:03:12.370	what's going on here?
C	00:03:12.370	00:03:13.531	that's what i'd like to know!
C	00:03:13.920	00:03:18.040	jack and sharon have been here for who knows how long, and who knows what they've been doing...
C	00:03:18.640	00:03:22.049	hey jack, it's time you tell me what's up!
C	00:03:22.159	00:03:25.030	i'm gonna get really mad if i don't get some answers!...
D	00:03:27.440	00:03:29.360	okay, stop!
D	00:03:29.360	00:03:30.630	stop!!
D	00:03:30.640	00:03:33.269	you're acting like little children...
D	00:03:34.879	00:03:39.160	come on jack, let's leave peter and sharon alone...
D	00:03:41.360	00:03:45.269	they need to talk and, and we need to go shopping!
C	00:03:57.020	00:03:57.952	so, shane?
C	00:03:59.920	00:04:00.870	what's going on?
A	00:04:03.680	00:04:07.290	peter, i have to tell you something i've never told you before...
A	00:04:10.400	00:04:12.220	i've known jack for a long time...
A	00:04:13.920	00:04:16.959	we went to the same university together and...
A	00:04:17.081	00:04:17.491	well...
A	00:04:19.519	00:04:21.120	we were once engaged!
C	00:04:21.220	00:04:21.684	what?!
C	00:04:25.040	00:04:27.060	so that's why jack came to live here!
C	00:04:28.960	00:04:30.560	you've been seeing each other, haven't you sharon?
A	00:04:30.560	00:04:33.600	no, peter, i swear it's true!
A	00:04:33.600	00:04:35.290	we just happened to meet him here.
A	00:04:36.240	00:04:37.280	it happened by chance.
C	00:04:37.280	00:04:38.400	by chance?
C	00:04:38.400	00:04:40.240	that's a strange stroke of luck!
C	00:04:41.360	00:04:44.160	just enough to bring back some old, passionate feelings??
C	00:04:45.680	00:04:48.000	how long has this been going on, sharon?
A	00:04:49.759	00:04:53.129	nothing has happened between jack and i...
A	00:04:54.639	00:04:56.150	even if i do...
A	00:04:58.160	00:05:00.220	still have some feelings for him.
A	00:05:02.560	00:05:05.210	after all, peter, you've been neglecting me for months...
A	00:05:06.960	00:05:09.230	the only thing that's important to you is your work!
A	00:05:10.240	00:05:14.070	you live, eat and drink theater and nothing else!
C	00:05:14.080	00:05:15.600	so you're saying this is my fault?
A	00:05:15.600	00:05:17.830	no one is at fault...
A	00:05:17.840	00:05:21.149	it's just that we want different things from life at the moment.
A	00:05:23.759	00:05:28.080	i've had  two interviews with the director of the archaeology museum...
A	00:05:29.680	00:05:32.240	they want to open an art exhibition...
A	00:05:32.240	00:05:34.000	and they've offered me a job...
A	00:05:35.280	00:05:37.080	do you understand peter?
A	00:05:38.880	00:05:41.290	it means a job i would really love!
C	00:05:44.720	00:05:46.260	what are you getting at, sharon?
A	00:05:50.240	00:05:53.550	would you stay here and not go to japan if i asked you?
C	00:05:54.560	00:05:56.210	what kind of question is that?
A	00:05:59.360	00:06:02.209	answer me peter, it's important...
A	00:06:03.919	00:06:05.220	i've accepted the job...
C	00:06:05.640	00:06:06.768	without asking me?
C	00:06:07.440	00:06:08.200	how could you?
A	00:06:09.558	00:06:11.425	did you ask me about japan?
A	00:06:12.000	00:06:13.180	did you peter, huh?
A	00:06:16.160	00:06:18.629	are you willing to stay here with me?
C	00:06:24.639	00:06:24.960	i...
C	00:06:26.415	00:06:27.585	i can't, sharon.
C	00:06:29.360	00:06:31.230	this is my big chance!
A	00:06:32.493	00:06:33.416	you see peter?
A	00:06:33.416	00:06:34.109	i'm right!
A	00:06:35.039	00:06:38.130	nothing is more important to you than your success!

B	00:06:57.440	00:07:00.250	so, it's just you and me, isn't it anne?
D	00:07:02.094	00:07:02.858	well...
D	00:07:04.077	00:07:08.693	really, it's just me, all alone!
B	00:07:09.679	00:07:10.869	are you still angry?
D	00:07:12.190	00:07:13.183	no!
D	00:07:13.280	00:07:15.000	i was just joking...
D	00:07:15.940	00:07:20.592	of course, it'll be difficult to forget a man like you.
B	00:07:20.960	00:07:23.200	you're just pulling my leg now, aren't you anne?
B	00:07:27.840	00:07:29.150	i wanted to say...
B	00:07:32.830	00:07:37.760	if it had been a different time in my life...
B	00:07:38.699	00:07:40.010	if there weren't sharon...
B	00:07:42.960	00:07:44.140	maybe we would...
B	00:07:45.840	00:07:46.749	or rather...
B	00:07:47.759	00:07:49.130	maybe we could...
D	00:07:51.919	00:07:54.230	too many 'ifs' jack!
D	00:07:56.080	00:08:00.240	anyway, i'm happy for both you and sharon...
D	00:08:01.360	00:08:02.099	really!
D	00:08:03.726	00:08:06.170	you know i adore 'love stories' with happy endings...
B	00:08:06.319	00:08:08.200	hey, don't jump to conclusions!
B	00:08:09.599	00:08:11.130	sharon just left peter...
D	00:08:12.059	00:08:12.648	okay.
D	00:08:13.440	00:08:16.060	let things take their natural course...
D	00:08:16.720	00:08:20.080	you know, as alice would say if, she were here.
B	00:08:20.250	00:08:23.482	i really miss her craziness and her jokes.
B	00:08:24.602	00:08:26.494	the house just isn't the same without her.
D	00:08:26.636	00:08:27.617	that's true.
D	00:08:28.479	00:08:30.290	she always had something to say.
D	00:08:33.540	00:08:38.460	i, i miss so many things...
D	00:08:41.279	00:08:42.139	like peter...
D	00:08:42.959	00:08:45.159	i even miss his singing exercises!
B	00:08:45.519	00:08:47.060	but they were awful!
B	00:08:47.440	00:08:49.150	our poor ears!
D	00:08:49.760	00:08:52.290	i know, but i was used to them.
D	00:08:53.519	00:08:57.220	by the way, how did things turn out in the end between you  two?
B	00:08:58.720	00:08:59.360	pretty well...
B	00:09:03.421	00:09:09.289	we had a long talk and he understood it really wasn't my fault...
B	00:09:10.080	00:09:11.290	that it was inevitable...
B	00:09:13.519	00:09:19.030	peter was just too involved with his career to notice. sharon's needs and desires...
B	00:09:20.240	00:09:23.766	let's just say i took advantage of their situation...
D	00:09:25.279	00:09:26.160	i'd say so!
D	00:09:28.202	00:09:31.480	you've never missed a chance like that in your life, have you?
B	00:09:36.000	00:09:36.584	it's late...
B	00:09:38.577	00:09:39.525	i have to go.
B	00:09:41.258	00:09:42.658	i'm late as usual.
B	00:09:46.128	00:09:50.414	by the way, sharon and i are going to see a film tonight.
B	00:09:51.316	00:09:52.598	would you like to come?
D	00:09:54.745	00:09:56.800	thanks for the invitation, jack.
D	00:09:57.285	00:10:00.722	um, but i'd prefer to stay home.
D	00:10:02.013	00:10:07.944	anyway, a possible new flatmate is coming to take a look at the apartment.
D	00:10:10.720	00:10:12.000	his name is nick.
D	00:10:14.320	00:10:17.130	actually, i've got to get things tidied up!
B	00:10:19.040	00:10:20.320	that's right!
B	00:10:20.555	00:10:23.566	cleanliness is next to godliness, eh?
B	00:10:24.480	00:10:26.000	don't work too hard, anne!
B	00:10:28.399	00:10:32.230	perhaps nick is less tidy than alice and i put together!
D	00:10:32.240	00:10:33.120	oh, no!
D	00:10:34.487	00:10:39.779	i lost the battle with you two but it's time to put an end to all this chaos!
D	00:10:40.819	00:10:47.711	i'll ask him all the right questions and if i get the feeling he doesn't like cleaning, i won't let him in the door!

C	00:10:58.240	00:11:03.000	hi sharon, could i speak to you for a moment?
A	00:11:04.389	00:11:07.225	sure peter, i'm listening...
C	00:11:08.640	00:11:13.140	you know, i thought a lot about what you told me...
C	00:11:15.440	00:11:16.000	well...
C	00:11:17.324	00:11:18.803	i have to admit you're right...
C	00:11:20.000	00:11:22.590	i haven't been paying very much attention to you.
C	00:11:25.600	00:11:28.200	i won't be angry if you don't wanna to stay with me.
A	00:11:30.000	00:11:33.910	oh peter, don't worry about me...
A	00:11:33.920	00:11:36.079	just look forward to your musical!
A	00:11:37.839	00:11:40.080	it's your big break, isn't it?
A	00:11:41.600	00:11:45.630	if you weren't so committed, you wouldn't be the man for the job now, would you?
A	00:11:46.640	00:11:47.979	you're a star, right?!
C	00:11:49.279	00:11:51.000	yes, i know...
C	00:11:52.639	00:11:56.000	it just isn't easy imagining japan without you!
A	00:11:57.600	00:12:00.000	it won't be easy for me either...
A	00:12:01.360	00:12:04.229	but i'm sure it's the right decision for both of us.
C	00:12:04.639	00:12:06.878	i hope so...
C	00:12:06.880	00:12:12.230	if i were rich and famous already, i'd send along my private jet, so you could visit me on weekends.
A	00:12:13.040	00:12:13.940	yeah, right...
A	00:12:15.040	00:12:17.250	the petrol alone would cost you your fortune!
C	00:12:17.760	00:12:19.040	who cares?
C	00:12:19.040	00:12:20.060	i'd be rich...
A	00:12:22.035	00:12:22.658	so...
A	00:12:23.920	00:12:30.000	while i wait for you to bring your career off and become rich, i might come visit you...
A	00:12:30.736	00:12:31.751	maybe with anne.
A	00:12:33.519	00:12:36.100	but if you're famous, you'll forget all about me.
A	00:12:37.680	00:12:42.000	you'd let it go to your head and wouldn't have time to take care of me...
A	00:12:44.480	00:12:47.280	i couldn't keep up with all those beautiful young actresses...
C	00:12:49.440	00:12:51.070	how could i forget you, sharon?
C	00:12:53.200	00:13:01.839	by the way, would you mind me taking that beautiful photo of you along to japan with me?
C	00:13:01.839	00:13:03.230	the one hanging in the living room.
C	00:13:05.920	00:13:07.230	it'll help me when i'm missing you...
C	00:13:09.519	00:13:11.070	especially in the beginning...
A	00:13:13.360	00:13:16.050	of course, peter, take it...
A	00:13:17.357	00:13:18.764	i'll be happy to give it to you.

C	00:13:21.116	00:13:21.680	well...
C	00:13:22.320	00:13:24.010	i have to get on with packing...
C	00:13:26.720	00:13:28.110	one last thing...
C	00:13:31.120	00:13:44.000	if we were to meet in a few years, in two apartments close to each other, you with your new boyfriend, would you pretend not to know me?
C	00:13:44.800	00:13:46.070	like you did with jack?
A	00:13:48.320	00:13:50.050	why do you ask me that?
C	00:13:50.855	00:13:53.144	oh, i don't know...
C	00:13:53.440	00:13:54.200	just curious...
C	00:13:56.320	00:14:02.260	i guess it would be fun to meet you somewhere else and to have a little secret between us two...

D	00:14:08.000	00:14:10.540	okay, sharon.
D	00:14:10.557	00:14:12.566	you remembered to buy the beer, right?
A	00:14:12.620	00:14:13.881	of course i did!
A	00:14:14.079	00:14:16.100	and you managed to bake the cake, right?
D	00:14:16.800	00:14:18.139	not yet...
D	00:14:18.139	00:14:20.199	i'm going to bake it this afternoon.
A	00:14:21.199	00:14:23.190	i still need to get some chocolate.
A	00:14:24.000	00:14:26.599	actually, jack offered to get some for me.
A	00:14:27.199	00:14:29.750	he promised to bring some before lunch.
A	00:14:29.760	00:14:34.710	sorry but i can't help you with the cake, i have to take some tourists to visit the tate gallery.
D	00:14:34.720	00:14:37.910	oh, don't worry about it, i'll have jack to help me.
D	00:14:37.920	00:14:40.910	he decided to stay home today to give me a hand.
D	00:14:41.920	00:14:48.070	just don't forget to tell tom, david, mary and all the others.
A	00:14:48.432	00:14:48.945	don't worry.
A	00:14:48.962	00:14:50.533	peter said he'd take care of it.
A	00:14:50.220	00:14:53.710	i'm sure he's already got in touch with everybody by phone.
D	00:14:54.910	00:14:57.587	great, everything is going as planned!
D	00:14:58.272	00:14:59.889	oh, don't forget to buy the present!
A	00:14:59.914	00:15:00.582	don't worry.
A	00:15:01.120	00:15:03.040	how about getting an astrology book?
A	00:15:03.040	00:15:04.170	she'd love that.
D	00:15:04.170	00:15:05.680	absolutely!
D	00:15:05.680	00:15:08.130	she loves reading those kinds of books!
A	00:15:13.313	00:15:15.731	i hope i can get it before i go to work.
A	00:15:16.926	00:15:19.277	by the way, have you heard anything from mr dubois?
D	00:15:19.716	00:15:24.240	but he told me he expected to come, but couldn't confirm...
D	00:15:24.800	00:15:32.550	well, you know how it is being so busy and everything, it's hard for him to give a definite answer one way or the other.
A	00:15:32.560	00:15:35.210	i imagine being a stage director is difficult!
A	00:15:36.240	00:15:38.480	alice would be so happy if he comes!
D	00:15:38.536	00:15:39.957	yes, she will...
D	00:15:40.880	00:15:46.100	anyway, mum's the word: if you say anything, it won't be a surprise!
E	00:15:48.480	00:15:50.959	hey everyone, what are you up to?
D	00:15:51.042	00:15:52.850	oh, nothing important...
D	00:15:53.440	00:15:55.190	oh, i almost forgot...
D	00:15:55.600	00:15:57.210	happy birthday alice!
D	00:15:57.839	00:15:58.290	so...
D	00:15:58.800	00:16:01.920	what have you arranged to do this evening?
E	00:16:01.920	00:16:05.230	well, i considered celebrating with you guys...
E	00:16:05.759	00:16:06.880	i mean...
E	00:16:06.880	00:16:08.240	if you want to...

D	00:16:09.120	00:16:11.680	i'm really sorry, but...
D	00:16:12.480	00:16:18.079	jack has arranged to eat out this evening with his colleagues and he can't put it off now.
D	00:16:18.079	00:16:18.959	and...
D	00:16:18.959	00:16:19.749	well...
D	00:16:19.759	00:16:22.140	i agreed to correct some reports...

E	00:16:25.519	00:16:27.060	what about you, sharon?
A	00:16:27.360	00:16:34.270	oh, i'm terribly sorry but i agreed to go to the theater with peter and he won't be finished rehearsing before midnight...
E	00:16:34.631	00:16:36.013	but i thought that
D	00:16:36.240	00:16:38.289	i know we promised to have a party...
D	00:16:39.199	00:16:42.169	but why don't we postpone it?
D	00:16:43.279	00:16:45.222	it's just not possible today...
E	00:16:45.759	00:16:47.000	what a shame!
E	00:16:48.800	00:16:53.020	i can't stand the thought of being all alone on my birthday!

E	00:16:54.160	00:16:56.220	hey, is anybody home?

E	00:17:03.279	00:17:04.120	what a shame!
E	00:17:04.720	00:17:08.100	i resent having to spend my birthday all alone.

E	00:17:32.599	00:17:34.640	oh, i'm so happy!
E	00:17:34.640	00:17:37.180	i didn't expect to find anybody here!
E	00:17:38.239	00:17:41.668	i thought i had to spend my birthday all by myself!
D	00:17:41.731	00:17:45.156	oh, did you really think we would forget to celebrate your birthday?
E	00:17:45.120	00:17:45.679	well...
