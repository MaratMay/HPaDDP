B	00:00:27.920	00:00:31.429	ok, i can't guess.
A	00:00:31.439	00:00:34.630	look at this.
B	00:00:34.640	00:00:35.600	wow!
B	00:00:35.600	00:00:40.950	it's a check for one hundred dollars.
A	00:00:40.960	00:00:45.430	it's my prize from a writing contest.
B	00:00:45.440	00:00:47.680	you are a winner!
B	00:00:47.680	00:00:49.840	that's great news!

B	00:00:56.239	00:00:59.990	you can give it to me.
A	00:01:00.000	00:01:04.710	you are funny, but i don't think so.
B	00:01:04.720	00:01:07.280	maybe you can buy stock.
A	00:01:07.280	00:01:11.119	i don't know anything about the stock market.
B	00:01:11.119	00:01:12.310	oh, dear.
B	00:01:12.320	00:01:14.080	i don't, either.

A	00:01:15.920	00:01:19.990	i can put the money in a bank account.
B	00:01:20.000	00:01:24.710	you can put it in my bank account.
A	00:01:24.720	00:01:30.479	betty! i can save the money in my account.
B	00:01:30.479	00:01:31.510	i know.
B	00:01:31.520	00:01:34.479	i'm just kidding.
A	00:01:34.479	00:01:37.439	hey, i have an idea.
A	00:01:37.439	00:01:39.590	let's go to the diner.
A	00:01:39.600	00:01:42.479	i can buy you lunch.
B	00:01:42.479	00:01:47.109	ok!

C	00:01:47.840	00:01:51.510	come back soon.
C	00:01:51.520	00:01:54.479	we're closed, finally.
D	00:01:54.479	00:01:55.830	are you glad?
C	00:01:55.840	00:01:58.399	i really am.
D	00:01:58.399	00:02:01.200	oh, is this your wallet?
C	00:02:01.200	00:02:02.159	no.
C	00:02:02.159	00:02:04.149	did a customer forget it?
D	00:02:04.159	00:02:06.079	i don't know.
D	00:02:06.079	00:02:09.109	maybe there is a lot of money inside!
C	00:02:09.119	00:02:12.390	maybe the owner's name is inside.
D	00:02:12.400	00:02:14.400	oh, right.
C	00:02:14.400	00:02:18.630	is there I.D. or a credit card?
D	00:02:18.640	00:02:19.120	yes!
D	00:02:19.120	00:02:22.470	it says, "maxwell."
E	00:02:22.480	00:02:23.920	maxwell?
E	00:02:23.920	00:02:26.229	only mom calls me maxwell.
E	00:02:26.239	00:02:28.080	hey, that's my wallet!
D	00:02:28.080	00:02:29.830	i found it!
D	00:02:29.840	00:02:31.760	can i borrow your credit card?
E	00:02:31.760	00:02:37.120	you can't use my credit card, it has my signature on it.
D	00:02:37.120	00:02:41.280	max, you have four credit cards in your wallet.
D	00:02:41.280	00:02:42.959	do you use them all?
E	00:02:42.959	00:02:44.630	yes. why?
C	00:02:44.640	00:02:46.480	are you in debt?
D	00:02:46.480	00:02:48.150	max is in debt!
E	00:02:48.160	00:02:49.200	no i'm not.
E	00:02:49.200	00:02:51.519	i'm careful when i charge things.
D	00:02:51.519	00:02:53.920	maybe i can get a credit card.
E	00:02:53.920	00:02:58.550	a debit card is a better choice for you.
D	00:02:58.560	00:03:02.000	why is a debit card better than a credit card?
E	00:03:02.000	00:03:05.910	using a debit card is like using cash.
C	00:03:05.920	00:03:09.430	yes, the money comes from your bank account right away.
E	00:03:09.440	00:03:13.190	that way you don't spend more money than you have.
D	00:03:13.200	00:03:16.229	oh, so i won't go into debt.
E	00:03:16.239	00:03:17.680	that's right.
C	00:03:17.680	00:03:20.550	and you don't pay interest.
D	00:03:20.560	00:03:24.070	wow, you're helping me manage my money.
D	00:03:24.080	00:03:25.680	thanks!
E	00:03:25.680	00:03:27.270	you're still young.
E	00:03:27.280	00:03:32.949	this is a great time to learn how to manage your money.
C	00:03:32.959	00:03:38.470	i agree. the earlier you start, the better.
C	00:03:38.480	00:03:43.040	max, who is the little girl in this picture?
E	00:03:43.040	00:03:44.400	that's sarah.
D	00:03:44.400	00:03:45.270	really?
C	00:03:45.280	00:03:46.879	that's so sweet!
E	00:03:46.879	00:03:53.519	i keep all my treasures in my wallet- my money, my credit cards and my little sister.

F	00:03:56.400	00:03:59.270	renee is in the diner with simon's brother,
F	00:03:59.280	00:04:05.990	rich. he has come from the big city to visit his little brother.
F	00:04:06.000	00:04:10.080	simon comes in to pick up renee after work.
F	00:04:10.080	00:04:13.350	he is surprised to see rich there.
F	00:04:13.360	00:04:17.110	rich gives simon a big hug.
F	00:04:17.120	00:04:20.469	rich has a card and gifts for him.
G	00:04:20.479	00:04:28.150	you're giving me more gifts to help me plan my finances.
G	00:04:28.160	00:04:32.790	thank you, rich.
H	00:04:32.800	00:04:43.510	you're welcome,one day you will be rich like me.
G	00:04:43.520	00:04:46.160	i don't want to be rich.
C	00:04:46.160	00:04:50.080	so what is this card?
H	00:04:50.080	00:04:51.670	it's a cash card.
H	00:04:51.680	00:04:53.759	they are popular in the city.
H	00:04:53.759	00:04:56.720	people say they are the new debit cards.
C	00:04:56.720	00:04:58.710	how do you use it?
H	00:04:58.720	00:05:01.840	you scan the card when you pay for something.
H	00:05:01.840	00:05:05.590	then the money is taken from the card.
G	00:05:05.600	00:05:08.160	how much money is on this card?
H	00:05:08.160	00:05:11.360	i put fivehundred on this card for you.
C	00:05:11.360	00:05:13.749	that's very generous.
G	00:05:13.759	00:05:17.510	rich, this card is useless in small town.
G	00:05:17.520	00:05:21.270	we don't have any cash card machines.
H	00:05:21.280	00:05:24.550	use it when you visit me in the big city!
G	00:05:24.560	00:05:25.919	rich.
C	00:05:25.919	00:05:33.749	you boys must be hungry,let me get you some chocolate cake.
H	00:05:33.759	00:05:35.759	you have a great wife.
G	00:05:35.759	00:05:37.350	yes, i do.
G	00:05:37.360	00:05:42.190	she's better than all the money in the world.

E	00:06:06.960	00:06:10.960	the birds are singing.
C	00:06:10.960	00:06:13.919	but, max, spring isn't here yet.
E	00:06:13.919	00:06:17.590	i know, but the weather is getting warmer.

C	00:06:30.080	00:06:32.309	but we can't close the diner today.
C	00:06:32.319	00:06:34.000	what about our customers?

E	00:08:56.880	00:08:58.959	he must be someone.
E	00:08:58.959	00:09:02.560	maybe he's even someone special.
E	00:09:02.560	00:09:06.720	sara, is jim your special someone?
I	00:09:06.720	00:09:07.590	max!

I	00:09:10.800	00:09:13.040	he's not my boyfriend.
C	00:09:13.040	00:09:17.829	we are trying to choose a valentine's day card for sara's friend.

C	00:10:14.959	00:10:19.600	no, it says, "thank you for being my friend."
I	00:10:19.600	00:10:20.560	that's all?
C	00:10:20.560	00:10:22.310	that's all.
E	00:10:22.320	00:10:24.079	that's not very romantic.
I	00:10:24.079	00:10:27.360	i know. i like it!
I	00:10:27.360	00:10:29.030	it's perfect!

G	00:12:56.959	00:12:59.360	i'm sorry, hugh.
G	00:12:59.360	00:13:01.590	it's not the perfect gift for her.

C	00:13:42.800	00:13:46.079	and max even let you use his kitchen.
G	00:13:46.079	00:13:50.629	well, he knows we celebrated our first valentine's day here.

G	00:14:14.959	00:14:16.541	you don't remember?
C	00:14:17.600	00:14:19.120	i'm just kidding.
C	00:14:19.120	00:14:21.199	of course i remember!
C	00:14:21.199	00:14:26.550	we were here at the diner and you read the poem on the stage.
G	00:14:26.560	00:14:27.920	i was nervous.

I	00:15:01.680	00:15:03.920	yes. i'm excited.
I	00:15:03.920	00:15:06.150	i'm writing letters to the children.
I	00:15:06.160	00:15:08.320	i hope they'll be encouraged.
C	00:15:08.320	00:15:10.560	you're tired.

I	00:15:34.480	00:15:40.235	max and i were so tired last night that we forgot to boil some of the eggs.
C	00:15:41.120	00:15:45.269	oh, no!
C	00:15:45.279	00:15:48.550	max, simon told me about your idea.
C	00:15:48.560	00:15:50.560	i love it.

E	00:16:11.040	00:16:12.720	let's take one car.
E	00:16:12.720	00:16:15.509	parking in the city is expensive.
G	00:16:15.519	00:16:18.240	ok. we can take our car.
E	00:16:18.240	00:16:20.949	we'll pick you up at your place at eight o'clock.

F	00:16:44.320	00:16:48.000	betty is sorting mail at the post office.
F	00:16:48.000	00:16:51.350	she sees an envelope with her name on it.
F	00:16:51.360	00:16:52.575	she opens it.
F	00:16:53.199	00:16:55.990	it's a birthday card.
F	00:16:56.000	00:17:00.470	when she opens the card, she hears music.
F	00:17:00.480	00:17:02.480	betty closes the card.
F	00:17:02.480	00:17:04.870	betty opens the card again.
F	00:17:04.880	00:17:07.839	the music starts again.
F	00:17:07.839	00:17:11.349	betty laughs and dances to the music.
G	00:17:14.000	00:17:15.360	hi, betty.
G	00:17:15.360	00:17:16.959	nice music.
B	00:17:16.959	00:17:17.839	thanks!
B	00:17:17.839	00:17:22.230	my nephew sent me this musical birthday card.
B	00:17:22.240	00:17:24.079	isn't it fun?
B	00:17:24.079	00:17:27.839	it says, "leap for joy!
B	00:17:27.839	00:17:29.830	it's your birthday!
B	00:17:29.840	00:17:33.510	happy leap year birthday!"
G	00:17:33.520	00:17:35.200	that's great.
G	00:17:35.200	00:17:38.870	so are you excited for your birthday tomorrow?
B	00:17:38.880	00:17:41.840	yes. i'm very excited.
B	00:17:41.840	00:17:46.230	i'm thinking about getting engaged.
G	00:17:46.240	00:17:47.120	what?
G	00:17:47.120	00:17:48.960	really?
B	00:17:48.960	00:17:51.600	no, not really.
B	00:17:51.600	00:17:54.720	but i could get engaged, you know?
G	00:17:54.720	00:17:56.799	how?
G	00:17:56.799	00:18:01.430	do you know someone who wants to propose to you?
B	00:18:01.440	00:18:02.640	no.
B	00:18:02.640	00:18:05.510	but i could propose to someone.
G	00:18:05.520	00:18:06.720	that's true.
G	00:18:06.720	00:18:09.350	some women do propose to men.
B	00:18:09.360	00:18:11.120	they do now.
B	00:18:11.120	00:18:20.630	but years ago in great britain and ireland, women could only propose marriage on february twenty ninth.
G	00:18:20.640	00:18:22.000	really?
G	00:18:22.000	00:18:24.070	that's interesting.
B	00:18:24.080	00:18:25.120	yes.
B	00:18:25.120	00:18:26.880	and you know what else?
G	00:18:26.880	00:18:27.840	what?
B	00:18:27.840	00:18:31.039	the man couldn't say no!
G	00:18:31.039	00:18:32.710	what if he did?
B	00:18:32.720	00:18:37.350	then he'd have to give the woman a gift.
G	00:18:37.360	00:18:40.131	sounds like a perfect day for women.
B	00:18:40.840	00:18:42.320	yes.
B	00:18:42.320	00:18:49.270	too bad it only came once every four years!
