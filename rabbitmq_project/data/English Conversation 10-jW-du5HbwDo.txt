B	00:18:02.459	00:18:04.880	visa requirements for what country?
C	00:18:04.880	00:18:06.840	does it matter what country?
B	00:18:06.840	00:18:10.140	yes. different countries have different requirements.
C	00:18:10.140	00:18:10.850	really?
B	00:18:10.850	00:18:16.363	yes. really for example New Zealand has different requirements than United States.
C	00:18:17.390	00:18:22.290	what is the best way to find information about visa requirements?
B	00:18:22.290	00:18:25.650	well maybe you can find information on the internet.
B	00:18:25.650	00:18:30.770	but the best thing to do is go to the embassy of the country you want to go to.
C	00:18:30.770	00:18:35.610	so if I go to the embassy I will find out what information I need.
B	00:18:35.610	00:18:37.730	that's right.
C	00:18:37.730	00:18:41.910	do you happen to know where the American Embassy is?
