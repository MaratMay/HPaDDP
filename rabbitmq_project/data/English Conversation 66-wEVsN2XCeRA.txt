A	00:00:36.640	00:00:44.310	well, cooking's not my favorite hobby, but i'm the only one who knows how to cook in this flat.
B	00:00:44.320	00:00:46.000	i can imagine.

A	00:12:55.839	00:13:02.079	let me explain: imagine me in fifty years.
E	00:13:02.079	00:13:08.160	you mean, you old, with your manias, your cleaning obsessions?
E	00:13:08.160	00:13:10.160	oh my god!

A	00:13:24.240	00:13:25.910	no way!
A	00:13:25.920	00:13:32.160	painting means brushes, colors, dirt and mess everywhere!

E	00:13:47.040	00:13:49.199	i'm just surprised, that's all.
E	00:13:49.199	00:13:52.079	you're usually highly technological.
D	00:13:52.079	00:13:54.160	that's not entirely true.
D	00:13:54.160	00:13:56.710	i like to use paper and pen as well.
A	00:13:56.720	00:13:58.720	okay, leave it, guys!

A	00:14:13.920	00:14:15.920	a new modem?
A	00:14:15.920	00:14:18.389	that's not exactly business.
D	00:14:18.399	00:14:23.110	yes, well, there's something wrong with mine.
D	00:14:23.120	00:14:29.189	okay, maybe it's not that important, i can go tomorrow morning.
A	00:14:29.199	00:14:32.470	that's very kind of you, jack.
