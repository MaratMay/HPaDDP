C	00:02:04.079	00:02:14.710	oh,oh,this detergent is made by syntax, the american multinational that makes household cleaning products.
C	00:02:14.720	00:02:16.861	i refuse to use this product.
C	00:02:17.230	00:02:19.015	you know i hate multinationals!
A	00:02:19.200	00:02:19.840	but it's just...
A	00:02:19.840	00:02:22.550	all detergents made by multinationals.
A	00:02:22.959	00:02:26.550	how are you supposed to clean a house if you refuse to use them?
C	00:02:26.560	00:02:27.599	you guess right!
C	00:02:27.599	00:02:29.159	i never do any cleaning!
C	00:02:29.280	00:02:31.147	my flatmates look after that!
A	00:02:31.200	00:02:36.390	oh i see, so you arranged to have your flat cleaned.
D	00:02:36.400	00:02:38.043	michelle, you're just like paolo.
D	00:02:38.400	00:02:40.710	look what a mess this house is in.
C	00:02:40.720	00:02:42.239	if it weren't for us...
B	00:02:42.239	00:02:46.280	if it weren't for you, i'd be chilled out palying my guitar.
B	00:02:46.160	00:02:48.382	none of your forced labor.
B	00:02:48.800	00:02:52.390	i see we spend most of the time of this holiday cleaning...
B	00:02:52.400	00:02:55.664	i am started to wonder if this holiday may have been a mistake.
A	00:02:56.180	00:02:58.877	come on paolo,stop complaining!
A	00:02:59.280	00:03:03.240	you'll be happy to see this place all spick and span!

B	00:04:26.531	00:04:30.085	sample recordings, auditions, the odd performance.
B	00:04:30.800	00:04:33.360	but never anything serious.
B	00:04:33.360	00:04:36.950	always ready for the big break!
C	00:04:36.960	00:04:42.070	you know, paolo, i think no one has understood your talent yet.
C	00:04:42.080	00:04:44.668	you'll see, you'll be successful one day.
B	00:04:44.731	00:04:46.150	i certainly hope so!
B	00:04:46.160	00:04:49.510	i need to make money somehow.
E	00:04:49.520	00:04:52.000	why don't you get a job?
E	00:04:52.000	00:04:54.800	something, until you make it as a guitarist.
B	00:04:54.800	00:04:55.669	what would i do?
B	00:04:56.130	00:04:57.578	work in a bank like you?
B	00:04:57.841	00:04:59.336	no, that's not for me!
E	00:05:00.335	00:05:03.006	it's not as if there are only banks to work in.
E	00:05:03.933	00:05:05.431	there are other jobs that you can do.
B	00:05:05.460	00:05:06.807	i know, i know.
B	00:05:07.221	00:05:09.066	i worked in a supermarket last year.

B	00:05:16.800	00:05:17.830	no, no...
B	00:05:17.840	00:05:20.479	normal jobs are not for me.
B	00:05:20.479	00:05:23.670	i am an artist.
F	00:05:23.680	00:05:25.840	what are you talking about?
E	00:05:25.840	00:05:27.830	about work...
E	00:05:27.840	00:05:30.880	oh by the way sarah, how's your pub coming on?
E	00:05:30.880	00:05:32.000	just a minute what was it called?
E	00:05:32.000	00:05:32.526	'blue moon'?
B	00:05:32.479	00:05:34.080	that's it.
F	00:05:34.080	00:05:36.000	you do it on purpose, don't you?...
F	00:05:36.000	00:05:37.600	making things worse...
F	00:05:37.600	00:05:39.830	with that sarcastic tone of voice!
F	00:05:39.840	00:05:41.680	you like making fun of me!
F	00:05:41.680	00:05:44.520	you're horrible!
E	00:05:46.479	00:05:47.680	but what did i say?
B	00:05:47.680	00:05:47.919	what?
B	00:05:47.919	00:05:49.430	didn't you know?
B	00:05:49.440	00:05:52.880	sarah's pub buurned down two years ago...
B	00:05:52.880	00:05:56.950	the insurance hasn't paid, they said the fire wasn't an accident.
B	00:05:56.960	00:06:01.480	sara's lost everything... included the sense of fun she used to have.
E	00:06:02.479	00:06:02.800	man!
E	00:06:02.800	00:06:04.080	i really messed up!
E	00:06:04.080	00:06:06.390	i didn't know that had happened!
E	00:06:06.400	00:06:09.590	we we spoke at christmas but she didn't say the pub burned down!
B	00:06:09.600	00:06:12.000	you know what sarah's like.
B	00:06:12.000	00:06:16.160	she doesn't like to speak this thing!
B	00:06:16.160	00:06:19.830	this experience has really changed her.
B	00:06:19.830	00:06:22.360	and i think this holiday will be good for her.
C	00:06:25.360	00:06:26.319	hey!

A	00:06:38.560	00:06:40.240	i don't think you need to add any more salt!
F	00:06:40.240	00:06:42.629	i really think that ravioli are rather tasteless!
A	00:06:42.639	00:06:44.639	let's see what they think!
A	00:06:44.639	00:06:47.029	would you like to try my ravioli?

B	00:10:27.200	00:10:32.920	'beautiful girl we brown eyes, dusting away my heart sights!'

D	00:10:39.040	00:10:41.910	you didn't clean the kitchen last night, did you?

C	00:10:44.720	00:10:48.230	oh no, i'm sorry, i can't touch that awful stuff!
D	00:10:48.240	00:10:49.990	when are you going to get the message?
C	00:10:50.000	00:10:52.040	i never touch that awful stuff!
C	00:10:51.760	00:10:54.470	i hate detergents and the multinationals that make them!
C	00:10:54.480	00:10:56.000	and i hate cleaning too!
C	00:10:56.000	00:10:56.700	oh come on!
C	00:10:56.700	00:10:58.200	we're on holiday!
A	00:10:59.279	00:11:01.440	what is this racket!
A	00:11:01.440	00:11:03.080	and what is going on in here?
A	00:11:02.800	00:11:04.790	has world war three broken out?
B	00:11:04.800	00:11:06.560	it's just started!
C	00:11:06.560	00:11:14.150	well, soldier sandra's launcher offensive but the 'paolo-michelle squadron' is responding well to the attack and will defend its position to the bitter end.
D	00:11:14.160	00:11:15.760	stop playing around.
D	00:11:15.760	00:11:16.949	roll your sleeves up!
D	00:11:16.959	00:11:21.120	the sooner we start working the sooner we'll finish and we'll be able to relax by pool.
C	00:11:21.519	00:11:22.240	wait a minute!
C	00:11:22.240	00:11:24.680	i was just thinking of going back to bed!
C	00:11:24.399	00:11:27.279	if i'd known what was waiting for me, i would have slept until midday!
A	00:11:27.279	00:11:30.400	maybe we could ask sarah to give us a hand.
C	00:11:30.160	00:11:31.680	well, you must be joking!
C	00:11:31.680	00:11:33.680	she just asked not to be disturbed!
C	00:11:33.360	00:11:36.710	and giving her a bad mood over the last couple of days...
C	00:11:36.720	00:11:38.480	well we could ask mike though.
A	00:11:38.480	00:11:39.750	oh no...
A	00:11:39.760	00:11:42.079	i just saw him a few minutes ago.
A	00:11:42.079	00:11:45.920	i asked him where he was going and he said he was going to the village to buy a newspaper.
A	00:11:45.920	00:11:51.519	he asked me if he should do some shopping, but i told him we'd all go to the supermarket together later on.
B	00:11:51.519	00:11:52.800	fantastic!
B	00:11:52.800	00:11:54.870	first running up, then the shopping!
B	00:11:54.880	00:11:57.519	just the sort of holiday that i'm dreaming of!
D	00:11:57.519	00:11:57.910	well...
D	00:11:57.920	00:12:00.240	it's only the four of us here!
D	00:12:00.240	00:12:01.960	let's share jobs out.
B	00:12:04.399	00:12:07.670	just a minute, just a minute...
B	00:12:07.680	00:12:09.000	i've got an idea!

B	00:12:14.320	00:12:19.839	how about you and anna having a cleaning competition, timed, in here?
B	00:12:19.839	00:12:22.310	you clear one part and you the other.
C	00:12:22.320	00:12:23.200	yes...
C	00:12:23.200	00:12:27.840	and i can keep the time and power provides some beautiful background music!
C	00:12:28.399	00:12:33.680	at the end we'll see who's been the fastest and of course which part of the kitchen shines the most!
B	00:12:33.680	00:12:35.509	i think it's a great idea!
B	00:12:35.519	00:12:39.350	you and anna are always arguing about who's the best at doing things.
C	00:12:39.360	00:12:42.870	oh this could be the right moment to show off your domestic skills!
C	00:12:42.880	00:12:47.360	and the winner will be crowned 'queen of housewives'!
C	00:12:47.360	00:12:49.480	what do you think?
A	00:12:50.160	00:12:50.790	um, well.
A	00:12:50.800	00:12:51.279	it's a...
A	00:12:51.279	00:12:53.200	it's an unusual idea...
A	00:12:53.200	00:12:56.240	it's very original but... but i'm not sure.
D	00:12:55.920	00:12:58.949	oh come on anne, why not?
D	00:12:58.959	00:13:00.680	it would be interesting!
A	00:13:01.519	00:13:04.000	oh, ok!
A	00:13:04.000	00:13:05.920	you've convinced me!

C	00:13:27.519	00:13:31.990	'sponge in hand, sandra's clean the tabs while anne is intently sweeping the floor.
C	00:13:32.000	00:13:36.639	now sandra is spraying the turtle onto the cooking rings, anne's started on the table.
C	00:13:36.639	00:13:40.470	time is passing by another contestant is showing signs of fatigue.
C	00:13:40.480	00:13:44.150	the race is open and nothing is separating the two cleaners.'
B	00:13:44.160	00:13:48.310	those college days were so long ago...
B	00:13:48.320	00:14:11.410	you are so clever, so beautiful too, but i never forgotten you, nothing's changed i still try love you, beautiful girl with brown eyes, dusting away my heart sighs...

B	00:14:19.360	00:14:23.720	come on michelle, we need to decide which is the cleanest part.

C	00:14:53.839	00:14:57.520	you finished together and both parts of the kitchen are perfectly clean.
A	00:14:58.320	00:15:01.680	ok, well maybe it's better this way sandra.
A	00:15:01.680	00:15:05.990	at least there'll be no arguing about... about who's better at cleaning!
D	00:15:06.000	00:15:10.790	yeah, you're right, let's forget our rivalries, at least for today.
D	00:15:10.800	00:15:12.680	come on let's shake on it!

F	00:15:34.800	00:15:36.389	sure...
E	00:15:36.399	00:15:38.079	um, well...
E	00:15:38.079	00:15:40.230	i'd like to apologize for the other evening.
E	00:15:40.240	00:15:41.680	i swear i didn't do it on purpose.
E	00:15:41.680	00:15:44.949	i didn't know anything about what had happened at the bar.
F	00:15:44.959	00:15:47.880	ok, i'll forgive you this time!
E	00:15:48.320	00:15:49.519	great!
E	00:15:49.519	00:15:52.080	i'm glad we've cleared up this understanding.
E	00:15:53.199	00:15:55.080	so tell me, how did the fire start?
F	00:16:00.160	00:16:01.680	i don't really know!
F	00:16:02.639	00:16:06.480	the lighting system had been checked two days earlier by the electrician.
F	00:16:06.480	00:16:09.120	and the sprinkler system was working fine too.
F	00:16:08.959	00:16:10.629	it had just been installed.
F	00:16:10.639	00:16:12.040	but it didn't work!
E	00:16:12.639	00:16:14.470	how's that possible?
F	00:16:14.480	00:16:16.399	i don't really know.
F	00:16:16.399	00:16:21.199	someone must have thrown a cigarette on the curtains which caught fire straight away.
F	00:16:21.199	00:16:23.749	the whole pub burned down in a few hours.
F	00:16:23.759	00:16:26.310	the fire brigade couldn't save the place.
F	00:16:26.320	00:16:28.389	it all went up in flames.
F	00:16:28.399	00:16:30.399	i wish i'd been more careful...
F	00:16:30.399	00:16:33.110	i wished i'd checked everything more carefully...
E	00:16:33.120	00:16:35.360	but it's not your fault sarah!
E	00:16:35.360	00:16:37.480	how could you prevented the fire?
E	00:16:38.720	00:16:41.080	come on, you've got to pull yourself out of this!
E	00:16:40.800	00:16:43.430	you can't spend your whole life thinking about your problems!
E	00:16:43.440	00:16:46.320	you used to be such a fun person...
F	00:16:46.320	00:16:48.150	life changes us mike.
F	00:16:48.160	00:16:51.680	we've all changed since our university days.
E	00:16:51.680	00:16:53.360	sure!
E	00:16:53.360	00:16:56.280	but i'd like to help you find your old enthusiasm again.
E	00:16:58.000	00:17:00.440	tell me, how can i possibly help?
F	00:17:02.480	00:17:03.519	well...
F	00:17:03.519	00:17:05.590	i'm not sure...
F	00:17:05.600	00:17:07.360	you're embarrassing me!
E	00:17:07.360	00:17:13.829	you shouldn't feel embarrassed, not with me, we've always trusted each other... no?
E	00:17:13.839	00:17:15.040	what time is it?
F	00:17:16.480	00:17:17.590	four fifteen...
E	00:17:17.600	00:17:18.319	oh no!
E	00:17:18.319	00:17:19.120	the match...
E	00:17:19.120	00:17:20.360	it's already started!
F	00:17:22.720	00:17:25.480	you know mike, we were talking just then.
E	00:17:26.319	00:17:27.280	yeah i know, i know!

F	00:17:34.160	00:17:36.640	you know that doesn't interest me in the slightest!
F	00:17:36.640	00:17:38.150	you haven't changed, mike!
F	00:17:38.160	00:17:43.000	all you think about is football, football's the only important thing in your life!
E	00:17:44.720	00:17:46.800	you're exaggerating now sarah!
F	00:17:47.520	00:17:49.590	and you don't understand anything!
F	00:17:49.600	00:17:51.440	all you care about is football!
F	00:17:51.440	00:17:54.880	maybe if i wore a manchester united shirt, you'd pay me more attention!
E	00:17:57.840	00:17:59.080	what did you say?

B	00:18:21.110	00:18:32.520	i'd like to tell you i love you, but i'm afraid of being wrong with you...
