F	00:15:57.759	00:16:02.870	at first he asked me to sing and then he asked me to act like a snob.
F	00:16:02.880	00:16:09.509	you know they're putting on my fair lady and they're looking for an actor to play the professor of pronunciation.
F	00:16:09.519	00:16:15.199	remember this professor transforms a simple flower girl into a high society star.

F	00:17:51.039	00:17:52.640	it's time to party.
F	00:17:52.640	00:17:53.830	we're going dancing.

C	00:17:54.960	00:17:56.640	dancing?
C	00:17:56.640	00:17:59.440	why aren't you always like this?
C	00:17:59.440	00:18:03.110	going to japan is making you much more fun.

D	00:18:03.120	00:18:05.039	hi everybody.
D	00:18:05.039	00:18:06.470	wow.
D	00:18:06.480	00:18:12.559	i'm really pleased to see everyone dressing up like this for me.
B	00:18:12.559	00:18:16.720	haha you'd like to be the center of attention wouldn't you?
D	00:18:16.720	00:18:19.600	well of course.
D	00:18:19.600	00:18:24.150	anne, that color really suits you.
D	00:18:24.160	00:18:32.870	and alice made up like that you look much older.
D	00:18:32.880	00:18:34.480	what's happening anyway?
D	00:18:34.480	00:18:36.950	why are you all so elegant?
D	00:18:36.960	00:18:38.960	did i forget something?
C	00:18:38.960	00:18:40.150	no jack.
C	00:18:40.160	00:18:42.870	we're going out to celebrate with peter.
C	00:18:42.880	00:18:45.830	he's going to play a role in a musical.
C	00:18:45.840	00:18:48.320	and he's moving to japan.
D	00:18:48.320	00:18:51.190	to japan?
D	00:18:51.200	00:18:54.470	what does sharon think about all this?
B	00:18:54.480	00:18:56.640	she doesn't know.
B	00:18:56.640	00:19:01.909	anyway, according to peter she'll be ecstatic about the idea of moving to japan.
D	00:19:01.919	00:19:06.710	moving to japan.
D	00:19:06.720	00:19:10.400	what does sharon have to do with peter's musical anyway?
C	00:19:10.400	00:19:12.240	we know how it is jack.
C	00:19:12.240	00:19:16.640	when two people are together they make changes together.
C	00:19:16.640	00:19:22.630	and anyway why do you care if peter and sharon move to japan?
D	00:19:22.640	00:19:24.720	i don't care.
D	00:19:24.720	00:19:31.110	but i really don't think that sharon is going to be happy about moving to japan.
B	00:19:31.120	00:19:33.440	that's what you think.
D	00:19:33.440	00:19:34.988	well of course.
D	00:19:34.988	00:19:37.669	i could be wrong.
C	00:19:37.679	00:19:41.510	in any case, it's useless to make guesses.
C	00:19:41.520	00:19:42.640	hey jack.
C	00:19:42.640	00:19:44.950	do you want to come with us?
D	00:19:44.960	00:19:46.960	not really.
D	00:19:46.960	00:19:54.160	tell peter i'm sorry but i don't really feel like celebrating tonight.
B	00:19:54.160	00:19:58.549	well you don't know what you're missing.
C	00:19:58.559	00:20:03.029	sayonara jack.

A	00:20:14.240	00:20:16.870	to the museum i sent my cv to.
A	00:20:16.880	00:20:18.880	i'm going to have an interview this afternoon.
F	00:20:18.880	00:20:21.029	oh great.
F	00:20:21.039	00:20:25.669	but i really don't understand why you're in such a rush to find a job.
A	00:20:25.679	00:20:26.880	you know very well.
A	00:20:26.880	00:20:29.909	i don't enjoy being a tour guide.
A	00:20:29.919	00:20:34.390	now let's get back to us.
A	00:20:34.400	00:20:37.120	where were you last night?
A	00:20:37.120	00:20:41.350	you didn't get home until three in the morning.
F	00:20:41.360	00:20:44.789	i was out with ann and alice.
F	00:20:44.799	00:20:46.400	listen sharon.
F	00:20:46.400	00:20:51.590	i have to tell you something very important.
A	00:20:51.600	00:20:54.159	what's the matter peter?
A	00:20:54.159	00:20:56.240	is something wrong?
F	00:20:56.240	00:21:00.390	well not really wrong but.
F	00:21:00.400	00:21:05.669	yesterday remember when i was waiting for you outside the gym?
F	00:21:05.679	00:21:08.000	you saw that director didn't you?
A	00:21:08.000	00:21:10.630	the one who wants to put on a musical in japan.
F	00:21:10.640	00:21:12.559	yes that's the one.
F	00:21:12.559	00:21:15.200	well he asked me to audition.
A	00:21:15.200	00:21:16.720	and?
F	00:21:16.720	00:21:23.190	well we had a meeting and the audition went very well.
F	00:21:23.200	00:21:24.452	it's a shame you weren't there.
F	00:21:24.452	00:21:26.159	i was fantastic.
F	00:21:26.159	00:21:28.149	let me tell you what happened.
F	00:21:28.159	00:21:38.950	firstly when i arrived they were rehearsing the first scene of my fair lady: a girl was selling flowers on the street and people were passing by without noticing her.
F	00:21:38.960	00:21:42.630	two men were watching the scene laughing all the while.
F	00:21:42.640	00:21:46.310	then i sat down because i didn't want to interrupt anything!
F	00:21:46.320	00:21:49.222	after that all of a sudden the director noticed me.
F	00:21:49.222	00:21:55.110	he called out to me and asked me to play one of the roles.
F	00:21:55.120	00:21:57.280	and here comes the best part.
F	00:21:57.280	00:22:04.159	finally while i was singing he interrupted me and he shouted great my boy.
F	00:22:04.159	00:22:05.520	the part is yours!
F	00:22:05.520	00:22:06.720	can you believe it sharon?
F	00:22:06.720	00:22:09.590	i got the leading part.
A	00:22:09.600	00:22:12.559	i'm really happy for you peter.
F	00:22:12.559	00:22:16.070	you should be happy for both of us.
A	00:22:16.080	00:22:17.760	why is that?
F	00:22:17.760	00:22:23.270	because we're gonna leave for japan in two or three weeks at the most.
F	00:22:23.280	00:22:28.070	you'll come with me, won't you sharon?
A	00:22:28.080	00:22:30.159	japan!
A	00:22:30.159	00:22:35.120	but but how?
A	00:22:35.120	00:22:36.592	this is such a surprise.
A	00:22:36.592	00:22:40.425	i i don't know peter.
A	00:22:40.425	00:22:42.390	i certainly wasn't expecting this.
F	00:22:42.400	00:22:44.159	what's the problem?
F	00:22:44.159	00:22:46.789	a change will do us both good.
F	00:22:46.799	00:22:49.679	what's keeping you here?
F	00:22:49.679	00:22:52.470	you don't seem happy with your work.
A	00:22:52.480	00:22:55.830	that's true i wanted to change.
