B	00:00:11.651	00:00:13.036	i'm glad you're here.
D	00:00:13.206	00:00:14.836	we've been here since noon.
B	00:00:14.974	00:00:16.817	made an incredible discovery!
C	00:00:17.168	00:00:18.425	what's this about?
D	00:00:18.957	00:00:24.932	well... according to michelle this house is home to the spirit of a young girl.
D	00:00:25.166	00:00:29.831	and this young girl is going to appear to us tonight as a ghost...
B	00:00:30.012	00:00:30.970	don't make fun!
B	00:00:31.024	00:00:31.993	it's true.
B	00:00:32.185	00:00:33.910	i red it in a book i found at home.
B	00:00:34.155	00:00:38.756	and i can feel it too, there's a strange atmosphere, almost surreal!
C	00:00:38.830	00:00:41.365	i think the only strange thing here is you!
D	00:00:41.482	00:00:42.962	that's exactly what i said!
B	00:00:43.058	00:00:44.549	OK,enough of that!
B	00:00:44.560	00:00:45.274	listen to me!
B	00:00:45.369	00:00:46.647	this is the plan for tonight:
B	00:00:46.924	00:00:51.429	when the moons are in the sky we'll get some candles and go and look for the ghost.
B	00:00:51.717	00:00:54.656	paolo, didn't you know anything about the story?
A	00:00:54.731	00:00:58.256	well, my grandfather did tell me something about it.
A	00:00:58.586	00:01:02.431	when i was a boy i used to go looking for spirits with my cousins.
D	00:01:02.420	00:01:03.943	and didn't you feel frightened?
A	00:01:03.964	00:01:05.637	I know, it was a great fun!
C	00:01:06.425	00:01:08.874	sure... everyone knows ghosts don't exist.
A	00:01:08.959	00:01:10.110	oh,you run there!
A	00:01:10.610	00:01:13.880	you know one night we heard some strange noises...
A	00:01:14.146	00:01:16.116	someone was shouting!
A	00:01:16.500	00:01:17.746	we were so scared!
A	00:01:18.161	00:01:22.155	and we ran up to our rooms my youngest cousin cried for two days.
A	00:01:22.261	00:01:23.699	he was so terrified.
C	00:01:23.987	00:01:24.945	what rubbish!
C	00:01:25.009	00:01:26.905	i think you just invented the whole story!
B	00:01:27.096	00:01:28.758	ok, stop arguing!
B	00:01:29.035	00:01:31.580	power and i are going to look for the ghost tonight.
B	00:01:31.708	00:01:33.135	sandra, you're coming with us?
D	00:01:34.062	00:01:38.002	i don't really believe in these things but if you're both going... well...
D	00:01:38.151	00:01:41.378	why not,it'll be a bit of change from the other evenings.
D	00:01:42.017	00:01:47.183	and, by the way, i'm quite curious to find out whether this ghost really exists or not.
B	00:01:47.864	00:01:49.781	sarah, are you coming with us?
C	00:01:50.260	00:01:54.425	oh no,i don't believe in spirits and i don't do such stupid things.
C	00:01:54.702	00:01:56.448	i'll just stay in my room and read.

C	00:02:03.946	00:02:04.894	i said no!
A	00:02:10.325	00:02:13.488	she wouldn't be like this if it hadn't burned down!
B	00:02:15.086	00:02:16.321	i know you're right!
B	00:02:16.726	00:02:19.793	well just let's try not to let our problems get us down!
B	00:02:20.347	00:02:24.501	sandra, can you call mike and anne and we'll tell them what's the plan for tonight!
D	00:02:24.522	00:02:25.012	okay.
A	00:02:26.364	00:02:34.789	ghost hunting under a full moon.

A	00:02:51.861	00:02:55.950	so, this is the abandonment ..yeah.
B	00:02:59.625	00:03:02.457	should never have gotten involved in this charade!
B	00:03:02.990	00:03:05.216	i still can't believe you persuaded me to come along.
A	00:03:05.301	00:03:07.942	come on, anne,you'll have fun!
C	00:03:10.924	00:03:14.439	can anyone tell me exactly what it is we're looking for?
B	00:03:14.662	00:03:17.538	mike! do you ever listen when people talk to you?
B	00:03:17.847	00:03:19.721	who are looking for the ghost of a young girl.
B	00:03:22.544	00:03:28.390	legend says the full moon's high in the sky she returns here to look for a young lover.
B	00:03:28.518	00:03:31.511	she walks up and down the secret spot where she used to meet him.
D	00:03:31.862	00:03:34.365	and where is the secret spot??
C	00:03:34.482	00:03:39.733	well, we don't know, but paulo told me the last year he'd heard strange sounds coming from this house.
D	00:03:40.180	00:03:41.309	we can start from here.
E	00:03:43.173	00:03:44.696	where here?
E	00:03:45.580	00:03:48.540	how can we possibly if we can't see anything in the dark!
E	00:03:48.615	00:03:49.627	don't worry!
E	00:03:49.914	00:03:51.331	i know this place very well!
B	00:03:51.235	00:03:52.790	ok silence!
B	00:03:52.971	00:03:54.739	otherwise we're not gonna hear anything!
C	00:04:11.183	00:04:15.315	did anyone ask sarah if she wanted to come along with us?
D	00:04:15.464	00:04:16.508	of course we did.
A	00:04:17.189	00:04:18.574	she isn't interested...
A	00:04:19.181	00:04:22.599	she doesn't believe in ghosts.
D	00:04:25.773	00:04:27.467	you know you still should have insisted.
D	00:04:27.477	00:04:30.044	it's not nice to leave her all by herself at night...
B	00:04:30.150	00:04:33.100	ok,can you please start searching again?
E	00:04:52.420	00:04:53.293	i don't see anything!
E	00:04:53.197	00:04:53.698	are you sure?
C	00:04:59.640	00:05:02.250	sure,they squeezed my shoulder.
F	00:05:04.780	00:05:08.840	it's me.
C	00:05:11.199	00:05:12.639	ok!
C	00:05:12.639	00:05:20.070	now that we've saw that mystery, silence everyone and and let's continue!
E	00:05:20.080	00:05:25.749	well, to be honest, this place is kind of.
C	00:05:25.759	00:05:26.560	creepy?
D	00:05:26.560	00:05:31.749	creepy, yes!
B	00:05:31.759	00:05:34.613	guys, guys wait for us!
B	00:05:36.021	00:05:36.735	please!

C	00:06:46.479	00:06:47.759	i'm not feeling very well!
C	00:06:47.759	00:06:49.440	i think i'm going to paint!

C	00:06:58.800	00:07:04.080	do you know what happens to the people who cross my path?
B	00:07:04.080	00:07:05.270	what happens?
C	00:07:05.280	00:07:06.960	a horrible death!
C	00:07:06.960	00:07:16.080	you must choose between being burnt alive or being eaten by wolves.
D	00:07:16.080	00:07:17.599	lady ghost,
D	00:07:17.599	00:07:20.710	i think there must be some misunderstanding here.
C	00:07:20.720	00:07:22.479	we're all going to leave now,
C	00:07:22.479	00:07:25.029	and let you know for your lover in peace and quiet.
C	00:07:25.039	00:07:25.919	right everyone?
C	00:07:25.919	00:07:27.440	don't move an inch!
C	00:07:27.440	00:07:28.790	it's too late.
C	00:07:28.800	00:07:32.230	your fate has been decided.
E	00:07:32.240	00:07:33.360	please don't kill us...
E	00:07:33.680	00:07:35.199	i didn't even want to come!
E	00:07:35.840	00:07:37.759	they forced me to come with them!
C	00:07:37.759	00:07:39.280	be quiet!
C	00:07:39.280	00:07:45.450	now, all of you close your eyes and put your hands up in the air.
C	00:07:49.120	00:07:51.260	and now...
B	00:07:56.840	00:07:59.520	sarah!
B	00:07:59.520	00:08:01.680	so you were the ghost?!
C	00:08:01.680	00:08:07.350	yes! i was in my room reading when i thought of dressing up and scaring all of you.
C	00:08:07.360	00:08:09.520	and i must admit it was worth it!
C	00:08:09.520	00:08:11.430	you don't know how funny you all looked.
C	00:08:11.440	00:08:15.830	your face is white with fear and your voice is pleading for mercy...
C	00:08:15.840	00:08:18.869	i've never had so much fun!
F	00:08:18.879	00:08:20.960	yes, but you gave us all a big shock!
A	00:08:21.280	00:08:24.869	yes, but if it made the old star come back,
A	00:08:24.879	00:08:28.610	then long live ghosts!

B	00:08:37.200	00:08:38.292	hi sarah.
C	00:08:38:788	00:08:40.952	hi sandra, what are you doing?
B	00:08:41.279	00:08:45.030	we're making some sandwiches for today's drive in the country.
C	00:08:45.040	00:08:46.399	what drive?
B	00:08:46.399	00:08:48.550	hasn't paolo told you about the trip.
B	00:08:48.560	00:08:52.070	today he wants to take us to visit an old farmhouse in the country.
B	00:08:52.080	00:08:56.310	it's supposed to be very beautiful, a perfect example of rural architecture.
C	00:08:56.320	00:08:58.240	that's right! i remember now.
C	00:08:58.560	00:09:02.310	paulo told us it was built by some rich italian-american.
C	00:09:02.320	00:09:05.040	a really eccentric character, a friend of his mother's.
D	00:09:05.040	00:09:07.360	ok girls, is everything ready?
C	00:09:07.360	00:09:09.519	we've almost finished.
D	00:09:09.519	00:09:11.519	what a wonderful smell they...
D	00:09:11.519	00:09:13.185	look and smell great!
B	00:09:13.211	00:09:15.040	keep your hands to yourself!
B	00:09:15.040	00:09:17.590	no one's touching these delicacies now...
B	00:09:17.600	00:09:21.068	you'll be able to taste them later when we have our picnic.
A	00:09:21.199	00:09:21.888	Paolo...
A	00:09:22.109	00:09:24.800	about this outing, where is the farm house?
D	00:09:24.800	00:09:27.750	in the countryside about Twenty kilometers from here.
A	00:09:27.760	00:09:32.080	and is it true that it's incredibly beautiful and that it belongs to an italian american?
D	00:09:32.320	00:09:35.519	yes! but it was designed by a dutch architect.
C	00:09:35.519	00:09:40.480	and it was built in the style of an eighteenth century tuscan farmhouse... right?
D	00:09:40.480	00:09:41.120	right!
D	00:09:41.360	00:09:43.269	believe me, it's a jewel.
C	00:09:43.279	00:09:46.000	i didn't know you were so interested in architecture!
D	00:09:46.240	00:09:47.670	my dear ladies.
D	00:09:47.680	00:09:50.790	there are so many things that you don't know about me...

D	00:09:54.000	00:09:57.829	i'm full of surprises...
A	00:09:57.839	00:09:59.664	no one doubts that, paolo.

A	00:10:05.373	00:10:07.737	so, tell me more about this house.
A	00:10:07.865	00:10:09.111	it's fascinating.
B	00:10:09.132	00:10:12.040	are you right and you have to see the garden.
B	00:10:12.381	00:10:14.830	it's a haven of decent tranquility!

B	00:10:35.949	00:10:38.548	it gave me a sense of peace.
B	00:10:40.066	00:10:41.674	that's where i gave my first kiss...
A	00:10:41.929	00:10:43.074	wow!

B	00:10:54.603	00:10:55.535	how did you know that?
A	00:10:55.737	00:10:58.522	considering it doesn't take much to inspire you...

A	00:13:12.223	00:13:15.616	well, a few days after we arrived,i happened to hear paolo's song...
A	00:13:16.148	00:13:17.708	i knew that it was about us two.
A	00:13:19.652	00:13:20.232	and...well...
A	00:13:20.999	00:13:23.076	you know what i mean... right?
A	00:13:28.241	00:13:30.643	after finding out about this this 'thing'.
A	00:13:31.117	00:13:33.662	i realized that i needed to talk to you straight away.
A	00:13:34.834	00:13:36.160	but i didn't have the courage.
A	00:13:38.146	00:13:39.983	we've known each other for a long time.
A	00:13:40.888	00:13:42.518	i've always thought a lot of you .

A	00:13:50.420	00:13:53.242	it's not easy to say certain things and...
A	00:13:53.402	00:13:57.678	i mean you know what it's like...put yourself in my shoes I.
B	00:14:00.021	00:14:01.193	you don't need to tell me this!
B	00:14:04.499	00:14:05.959	for years i've been trying to...
B	00:14:09.766	00:14:11.385	but...maybe...
B	00:14:12.327	00:14:13.648	as we've come this far...
B	00:14:15.379	00:14:16.353	we don't need words.
A	00:14:16.497	00:14:18.318	no, what are you doing,you're going crazy?
B	00:14:20.810	00:14:24.271	but... but i thought,i thought that...

B	00:14:45.087	00:14:46.173	what an idiot i am!
B	00:14:49.624	00:14:54.992	for for a moment i thought feelings for me.
A	00:14:55.396	00:14:59.901	i'm sorry Mike, I didn't want to to upset you!
A	00:15:03.277	00:15:07.473	the truth is that there's someone else in my heart!
B	00:15:09.891	00:15:11.052	i know!
B	00:15:14.833	00:15:15.759	don't worry!
B	00:15:20.083	00:15:21.830	let's pretend nothing's happened, ok?
B	00:15:22.831	00:15:25.004	ok!right.

A	00:15:47.486	00:15:48.498	see you in a bit.

C	00:16:03.823	00:16:08.626	so, it's not true you were only interested in football and nothing else?
B	00:16:09.457	00:16:10.575	what are you trying to say?
C	00:16:11.608	00:16:12.950	don't play the fool with me mike.
C	00:16:13.206	00:16:14.963	i understand lots of things now!
C	00:16:15.634	00:16:17.370	like the time i told you i loved you!
C	00:16:17.817	00:16:18.861	do you remember?
C	00:16:25.560	00:16:27.839	at that time we were always together.
C	00:16:28.095	00:16:31.290	and i thought there was more between us than just simple friendship!
B	00:16:32.131	00:16:34.208	come on sarah, not that old story again!
B	00:16:34.421	00:16:36.327	i mean, there's no point going over all of that again.
C	00:16:37.137	00:16:40.981	well, i think it's time to put a few things straight once and for all.
C	00:16:41.887	00:16:45.870	at that time you told me you weren't in love with me and that you didn't want to deceive me!
C	00:16:46.871	00:16:49.832	i felt rejected and thought that football was to blame.
C	00:16:50.503	00:16:54.006	i thought that football was the only passion in your life.
C	00:16:55.103	00:16:56.392	but now...
B	00:16:57.617	00:16:58.650	now what?
C	00:16:59.907	00:17:01.153	oh,stop it, mike!
C	00:17:01.355	00:17:03.666	i saw you here just now with anne.
B	00:17:05.189	00:17:07.745	wait a minute sarah, let me explain things...
C	00:17:08.522	00:17:09.939	you don't need to explain!
C	00:17:10.429	00:17:11.686	i'm not angry!
C	00:17:12.953	00:17:17.671	in fact you...all of you have helped me a lot in the past few days.
C	00:17:18.576	00:17:21.846	i'm at peace with myself again, and this is really important...
C	00:17:22.676	00:17:32.613	and to be honest i'm glad to have found out the true reason for your refusal was another woman and not and not football!
B	00:17:35.126	00:17:37.480	i think of you more than any sport, sarah!

A	00:17:44.435	00:17:46.895	hey guys! it's late!
