A	00:07:13.694	00:07:16.521	It's just how I imagine an apartment in Paris.
B	00:07:16.575	00:07:17.908	Everything's old.

A	00:08:57.130	00:08:58.872	I mean it's her first time in Paris, isn't it?
E	00:08:59.317	00:09:01.860	i don't think churches are really her thing.
A	00:09:02.055	00:09:03.709	how about taking her on a boat trip?
C	00:09:03.993	00:09:04.740	brilliant!
A	00:09:04.811	00:09:06.109	and then we can go up the eiffel tower.
C	00:09:06.350	00:09:08.439	that's a good idea i'm sure she'll love the view.
E	00:09:08.581	00:09:10.004	and she might fall off.
A	00:09:10.590	00:09:11.657	thanks for your help, Ben.
A	00:09:12.102	00:09:13.346	shall we have lunch after that?
C	00:09:13.720	00:09:15.160	let's go somewhere really nice.
C	00:09:15.516	00:09:17.134	Do you have any recommendations, Ben?
E	00:09:17.596	00:09:20.850	What about La renaissance? That's Jacques' favorite.
C	00:09:20.921	00:09:22.059	That sounds perfect!
C	00:09:22.824	00:09:24.816	Ben, do you want to come, too?
E	00:09:25.829	00:09:27.430	sorry Allie.
E	00:09:27.500	00:09:28.710	i'm really busy.
E	00:09:29.137	00:09:31.555	but i'm sure you'll have an unforgettable meal.

A	00:09:44.713	00:09:47.274	so scarlett, what would you like?
G	00:09:47.772	00:09:48.430	nothing.
A	00:09:49.763	00:09:50.812	aren't you hungry?
G	00:09:51.204	00:09:53.053	sure but this food's really horrible.
C	00:09:53.640	00:09:56.060	this is one of the finest restaurants in Paris.
G	00:09:56.147	00:09:57.130	well I can't eat this stuff.
G	00:09:57.658	00:09:58.870	I never touch meat.
C	00:09:59.241	00:10:00.414	the seafood looks good.
G	00:10:01.161	00:10:01.695	hey.
G	00:10:02.281	00:10:03.384	fish have feelings, too.
A	00:10:04.184	00:10:05.589	what about the mushroom risotto?
G	00:10:06.478	00:10:07.207	mushrooms.
G	00:10:08.256	00:10:08.950	no way. 
G	00:10:10.212	00:10:12.310	didn't they tell you guys about my allergies 
G	00:10:14.622	00:10:17.200	i'm allergic to mushrooms strawberries nuts
A	00:10:17.235	00:10:18.356	shall we go someplace else?
G	00:10:18.979	00:10:20.311	whatever.
G	00:10:20.480	00:10:21.770	i'm going to the restroom.
C	00:10:28.687	00:10:30.537	well, that was a disastrous morning.
C	00:10:30.820	00:10:33.897	the boat trip made her feel sick and she wouldn't go up the eiffel tower. 
C	00:10:34.395	00:10:35.871	"I can't stand heights."
A	00:10:35.940	00:10:37.597	it's a pity,we didn't just take her shopping.
C	00:10:38.129	00:10:39.498	she's so spoilt.
A	00:10:39.747	00:10:41.579	oh, come on,she's just a kid really.
C	00:10:42.290	00:10:44.566	so, what are we going to do about lunch?
C	00:10:44.869	00:10:45.758	shall we leave now?
A	00:10:47.073	00:10:47.909	no, hang on.
A	00:10:48.069	00:10:48.923	I have an idea.
A	00:10:49.083	00:10:50.096	let me talk to the waiter.
A	00:10:51.608	00:10:53.902	do you think you could possibly do me a favor?
H	00:10:54.097	00:10:55.698	yes, of course, sir,what would you like?

A	00:11:06.206	00:11:08.234	well, i think this place is great.
A	00:11:09.051	00:11:09.887	more wine, Allie?
C	00:11:10.012	00:11:11.079	No, thanks.
H	00:11:13.280	00:11:13.888	Mademoiselle.
G	00:11:15.645	00:11:16.240	what's this?
A	00:11:17.107	00:11:18.316	it's your lunch, scarlett.
G	00:11:19.310	00:11:20.556	but i didn't order anything.
G	00:11:24.877	00:11:27.918	hey, pizza margarita.
G	00:11:28.096	00:11:28.842	cool!
C	00:11:38.267	00:11:40.290	that was a great concert last night, scarlett.
G	00:11:40.294	00:11:40.827	thanks.
C	00:11:41.698	00:11:44.580	As we know Scarlet's got a new CD coming out soon.so
C	00:11:44.935	00:11:47.958	let's have a look at the best way we can promote it in france
A	00:11:48.153	00:11:48.687	ok.
A	00:11:49.220	00:11:52.403	well, I think scarlett should visit the major music stores.
A	00:11:52.456	00:11:54.999	in my opinion, that's the best way to meet fans.
C	00:11:55.533	00:11:56.546	I'm not so sure.
C	00:11:56.831	00:11:57.798	what do you think, jacques?
D	00:11:58.218	00:11:59.925	actually i don't agree with Mark.
D	00:12:00.956	00:12:03.677	scarlet isn't commercial in that way.
C	00:12:04.388	00:12:04.904	scarlett?
C	00:12:06.344	00:12:06.824	scarlet?
G	00:12:08.085	00:12:08.993	I agree with jacques.
G	00:12:09.766	00:12:11.021	I don't have a commercial image.
G	00:12:11.074	00:12:11.945	it isn't my style.
A	00:12:12.532	00:12:14.879	ok, but scarlet needs more publicity.
A	00:12:15.181	00:12:17.938	what about a series of TV and radio interviews?
A	00:12:17.991	00:12:18.773	don't you agree?
C	00:12:18.862	00:12:20.427	yes, that's what everybody does.
C	00:12:21.014	00:12:22.614	what we want is something different.
D	00:12:24.357	00:12:29.051	personally, i think scarlett should tour clubs and summer festivals.
D	00:12:30.545	00:12:37.815	she can DJ, play her favorite music, play the new CD and meet her fans, too.
C	00:12:38.173	00:12:40.894	yes, absolutely,that's a much better idea.
C	00:12:41.552	00:12:42.138	mark?
A	00:12:44.237	00:12:45.286	ok, why not?
C	00:12:46.246	00:12:46.744	scarlet?
G	00:12:47.828	00:12:48.931	I think.
G	00:12:55.617	00:12:56.541	that's a great idea.
G	00:12:57.733	00:12:58.871	thank you, jacques.
C	00:13:13.042	00:13:14.885	it's great to be on our own again.
A	00:13:14.839	00:13:15.568	yeah.
C	00:13:15.692	00:13:17.684	this is the first time you've been to the Louvre?
A	00:13:17.808	00:13:18.555	uh-huh.
C	00:13:19.498	00:13:20.191	what's the matter?
C	00:13:21.507	00:13:22.787	is this about the meeting?
C	00:13:23.018	00:13:24.850	because i agreed with jacques and not with you.
A	00:13:25.348	00:13:27.624	yeah, well, we knew it wouldn't be easy.
A	00:13:27.748	00:13:28.957	working together, i mean.
C	00:13:29.331	00:13:31.073	it's difficult for me as well.
C	00:13:31.127	00:13:32.336	but if i don't agree with you.
A	00:13:32.407	00:13:33.794	i know, i know, you're the boss.
C	00:13:33.847	00:13:35.039	and i have to do my job.
C	00:13:35.163	00:13:37.405	i really thought that jacques' idea was better.
C	00:13:37.420	00:13:39.360	and so did scarlet.
A	00:13:39.431	00:13:40.907	it's not a big deal, Allie.
A	00:13:41.262	00:13:42.116	i'm fine, really.
A	00:13:44.676	00:13:46.508	so who exactly was the Mona Lisa?
C	00:13:47.468	00:13:48.482	i'm not sure.
C	00:13:49.122	00:13:50.765	i think she was the wife of a banker.
A	00:13:51.273	00:13:52.480	is that why she's smiling?
A	00:13:52.500	00:13:54.332	because her husband has a good salary?
C	00:13:54.687	00:13:58.297	i also read somewhere that she was a self-portrait of Leonardo.
A	00:13:58.439	00:14:00.129	a self-portrait? you're kidding?
A	00:14:01.720	00:14:05.250	now, i don't know much about art... ...but leonardo da vinci was a man, right?
C	00:14:05.605	00:14:07.188	well, it's just a theory.
C	00:14:09.073	00:14:10.229	why do you think she's smiling?
A	00:14:11.864	00:14:16.150	well, in my opinion, she's the managing director of a music company.
C	00:14:16.577	00:14:17.288	what?
A	00:14:17.570	00:14:20.382	she lives in paris, she's in love with her marketing director...
A	00:14:20.560	00:14:22.658	and she has a lot of fun telling him what to do.
C	00:14:22.720	00:14:24.080	that's really unfair!
A	00:14:24.292	00:14:25.634	hey, we're not in the office now.
A	00:14:25.650	00:14:26.801	you can't tell me i'm wrong.
A	00:14:27.810	00:14:28.550	let's get a coffee.
C	00:14:28.590	00:14:29.290	good idea.
A	00:14:30.091	00:14:30.873	don't turn around!
C	00:14:31.085	00:14:31.478	what is it?
A	00:14:32.349	00:14:33.914	i just seen ben from the office.
C	00:14:33.985	00:14:34.447	where?
A	00:14:34.518	00:14:35.514	i said don't look!
A	00:14:36.680	00:14:38.180	I don't think he's seen us. let's get out of here.
A	00:14:38.181	00:14:38.537	come on!

E	00:14:41.250	00:14:42.075	hi.
B	00:14:43.040	00:14:43.800	hi
D	00:14:43.830	00:14:44.000	hello
B	00:14:44.020	00:14:45.030	did you have a nice weekend?
E	00:14:45.140	00:14:48.921	oh, yeah, you'll never guess who i saw on Saturday.
B	00:14:48.970	00:14:49.419	who?
E	00:14:49.775	00:14:54.505	Allie and mark in the Louvre together.
B	00:14:55.279	00:14:55.920	really?
D	00:14:56.514	00:14:57.510	you're joking.
E	00:14:57.705	00:14:59.377	it was definitely them.
E	00:15:00.100	00:15:01.279	and they looked really close.
E	00:15:01.279	00:15:03.111	i think they were holding hands.
D	00:15:03.199	00:15:05.174	no, i don't believe it.
E	00:15:05.150	00:15:05.680	it's true.
E	00:15:05.680	00:15:06.615	i'm telling you.
E	00:15:07.468	00:15:12.235	and i think they saw me because they turned and left really quickly.
D	00:15:12.678	00:15:14.207	are you serious?
B	00:15:14.527	00:15:16.003	you know, i'm not surprised.
B	00:15:16.287	00:15:19.064	i think they've been seeing each other ever since mark arrived.
B	00:15:19.650	00:15:21.213	or maybe even before.
D	00:15:21.728	00:15:22.831	that's incredible.
D	00:15:23.115	00:15:24.147	what makes you say that?
B	00:15:24.440	00:15:28.750	when i went to look at mark's new apartment, i'm sure Allie called them on his mobile.
B	00:15:28.950	00:15:32.433	and i've seen her looking at him... in certain way...
E	00:15:32.450	00:15:34.442	hey, quiet everyone. it's mark.
A	00:15:37.910	00:15:38.354	hi.
B	00:15:38.490	00:15:40.061	hi,good morning.

A	00:15:53.040	00:16:04.031	dear all, please find attached a copy of the latest sales report from the USA. mark.
A	00:16:06.396	00:16:08.210	so did you guys have a good weekend?
E	00:16:08.654	00:16:09.685	yes, fine.
D	00:16:10.183	00:16:11.766	not bad, very quiet.
D	00:16:12.513	00:16:13.455	what about you, mark?
A	00:16:14.060	00:16:16.194	oh, i spent most of the time at home.
A	00:16:16.265	00:16:17.865	just being domestic, you know.
A	00:16:18.221	00:16:20.248	the apartment's looking pretty nice now.
A	00:16:20.639	00:16:22.328	you must come around for a meal one evening.
D	00:16:22.879	00:16:24.285	that would be very nice.
E	00:16:25.422	00:16:27.254	so didn't you go out at all?
A	00:16:28.175	00:16:28.996	oh, sure.
A	00:16:29.067	00:16:30.775	i went to the louvre on saturday.
A	00:16:30.881	00:16:32.500	i felt like getting a bit of culture.
D	00:16:33.050	00:16:34.082	on your own?
A	00:16:35.273	00:16:36.000	yeah.
A	00:16:36.714	00:16:42.866	i kind of prefer going to museums and galleries on my own. you can look at everything at your own pace.
E	00:16:42.919	00:16:43.773	that's funny.
E	00:16:44.804	00:16:46.849	i went to the louvre on saturday, too.
A	00:16:47.169	00:16:47.809	really?
A	00:16:48.681	00:16:50.014	I,I didn't see you.
E	00:16:50.174	00:16:51.650	well, it's a big place.
E	00:16:52.415	00:16:53.659	I didn't see you either.
B	00:17:00.080	00:17:01.910	i've just had an email from Allie.
D	00:17:04.257	00:17:05.218	So have I.
A	00:17:07.156	00:17:07.938	me, too.
B	00:17:10.054	00:17:13.895	dear mark, thank you for the information.
B	00:17:14.233	00:17:17.505	and thank you, darling, for a wonderful weekend. Allie.
A	00:17:27.338	00:17:28.050	mark ryder.
C	00:17:28.316	00:17:29.312	mark, can you come in?
A	00:17:30.716	00:17:31.339	sure.

C	00:17:38.770	00:17:40.265	thanks for the sales report.
A	00:17:40.310	00:17:42.808	i think there's something more important to talk about right now.
C	00:17:43.146	00:17:43.910	what do you mean?
A	00:17:43.981	00:17:45.262	that message you sent me.
A	00:17:45.315	00:17:46.790	you hit 'reply to all'.
A	00:17:46.850	00:17:48.711	you sent it to everyone in the office.
C	00:17:48.782	00:17:51.094	oh, no. you're joking.
C	00:17:51.890	00:17:55.522	oh, mark, i'm so sorry, i did it without thinking
A	00:17:55.682	00:17:56.660	it's all right, Allie.
A	00:17:56.661	00:17:57.869	it's an easy mistake to make.
C	00:17:57.940	00:17:59.168	how could i be so stupid?
C	00:17:59.789	00:18:01.372	i just wasn't concentrating.
A	00:18:01.375	00:18:02.834	Allie.
C	00:18:02.492	00:18:03.879	i'm really sorry.
A	00:18:04.235	00:18:05.235	don't worry about it.
A	00:18:05.240	00:18:05.900	it doesn't matter.
A	00:18:06.440	00:18:08.100	but i think we should talk to the others.
C	00:18:08.485	00:18:09.765	yes, you're right.
C	00:18:10.730	00:18:12.108	i'll do it,it was my fault.

C	00:18:14.335	00:18:15.615	listen, everybody.
C	00:18:17.530	00:18:20.256	i just want to say that i'm terribly sorry.
C	00:18:20.260	00:18:21.469	i haven't been honest with you.
C	00:18:22.920	00:18:25.359	we, mark and I...
C	00:18:26.080	00:18:26.515	well...
B	00:18:26.585	00:18:27.671	that's ok, Allie.
B	00:18:28.270	00:18:29.640	we had already guessed.
B	00:18:29.840	00:18:31.476	it wasn't really a surprise.

C	00:18:39.679	00:18:42.450	i still can't work out how they knew about us.
C	00:18:42.650	00:18:45.150	i was always really careful not to treat you differently.
A	00:18:44.919	00:18:47.480	but you were really hard on me.
C	00:18:47.500	00:18:48.635	Mark, I wasn't.
A	00:18:48.880	00:18:51.178	oh, you were just being fair and very British.
C	00:18:51.230	00:18:52.512	so if it wasn't me.
C	00:18:52.580	00:18:53.703	it must have been you.
A	00:18:53.917	00:18:54.717	what?
C	00:18:55.320	00:18:56.477	i've got my own office.
C	00:18:56.480	00:18:58.060	you're with them all the time.
C	00:18:58.000	00:18:59.461	you must have said something.
C	00:18:59.462	00:19:01.080	you're hopeless at keeping secrets!
A	00:19:01.081	00:19:02.328	don't blame me.
A	00:19:02.329	00:19:03.450	this wasn't my fault.
A	00:19:03.780	00:19:05.280	they probably just guess.
C	00:19:05.510	00:19:06.280	how?
A	00:19:06.980	00:19:09.689	you know the french, they're experts on love affairs.
C	00:19:09.973	00:19:10.614	maybe.
A	00:19:11.983	00:19:13.939	actually, i think it's great that everyone knows.
A	00:19:13.949	00:19:15.486	now we don't have to pretend anymore.
C	00:19:15.440	00:19:17.016	yeah, that's true.
A	00:19:19.679	00:19:23.452	Allie, there's something i've been wanting to ask you for a long time.
A	00:19:23.559	00:19:24.963	i just haven't said anything.
A	00:19:26.170	00:19:27.542	but it's now or never.
A	00:19:29.440	00:19:33.760	Allie, Will you ?
C	00:19:35.686	00:19:37.517	sorry mark, i didn't hear a word you said.
A	00:19:39.384	00:19:40.078	i said...
A	00:19:41.580	00:19:42.496	will you marry me?
C	00:19:45.020	00:19:45.260	Yes
A	00:19:49.000	00:19:50.053	was that a 'yes'?
C	00:19:50.249	00:19:51.138	yes!
A	00:19:56.188	00:19:58.339	can you confirm that in an email for me?
A	00:19:58.380	00:20:04.750	just don't send it to everyone in the office this time.
