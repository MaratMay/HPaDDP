A	00:03:51.040	00:03:53.741	doing the shopping is very different from going shopping.
A	00:03:54.176	00:03:56.170	doing the shopping is food shopping.
A	00:03:56.550	00:04:01.493	oh that reminds me i have to go to the supermarket to get some housekeeping things do you need anything?
B	00:04:01.599	00:04:04.879	no,i stay here and start vacuuming.

C	00:08:59.832	00:09:05.735	i can't understand it and you don't have to tell me if you don't want to.
A	00:09:06.720	00:09:11.200	thanks for that where's the butter for frying.
C	00:09:11.200	00:09:15.200	you don't need all that butter you should use olive oil instead.
C	00:09:15.200	00:09:16.630	it's better for you.
C	00:09:16.640	00:09:26.399	i read an article in the newspaper about depression and the foods we eat what we eat affects our personality and how we react to others.
A	00:09:26.399	00:09:29.269	i know if i don't eat i'm not a nice person.
A	00:09:29.279	00:09:31.509	okay, i can't live on meat alone.
A	00:09:31.519	00:09:37.519	there are the food groups breads cereals rice and pasta poultry and fish.

A	00:09:42.240	00:09:44.000	yeah. yeah.
C	00:09:44.000	00:09:50.150	you use too much butter you don't have to give up your butter and chocolate biscuits.
C	00:09:50.160	00:09:57.440	i'm just saying you should use less,it will help you to stay healthy and fit and that's a good thing isn't it?
A	00:09:57.440	00:09:58.720	sure.
C	00:09:58.720	00:10:03.670	but you have to eat more vegetables they're an important source of vitamins?

C	00:10:09.839	00:10:12.480	you should go to a doctor and have a checkup?
A	00:10:12.480	00:10:13.272	that's enough.
A	00:10:14.480	00:10:15.920	i can't take it anymore.
A	00:10:15.920	00:10:18.790	you have to stop trying to control my life.
A	00:10:18.800	00:10:21.040	you should respect my life and how i live it?
C	00:10:21.040	00:10:24.399	i'm sorry i just think that you should do things?
A	00:10:24.399	00:10:25.279	you should.
A	00:10:25.279	00:10:26.079	you shouldn't.
A	00:10:26.079	00:10:26.720	you can't.
A	00:10:26.720	00:10:27.360	you must.
A	00:10:27.360	00:10:28.000	you mustn't.
A	00:10:28.000	00:10:29.279	not everyone is like you.
A	00:10:29.279	00:10:34.310	i thank goodness i don't have to explain my lifestyle to you?
C	00:10:34.320	00:10:41.200	oh dear what have i done?
C	00:10:41.200	00:10:50.949	oh did i offend him?
A	00:10:50.959	00:10:54.279	uh why do you have those bags.
A	00:10:54.533	00:10:55.862	where are you going,Agatha?
C	00:10:57.302	00:11:00.676	i've already decided i'm moving out.
A	00:11:01.760	00:11:08.079	what? now? you're leaving now?where are you going?
B	00:11:08.079	00:11:11.750	what,what has happened why are you moving out?
C	00:11:11.760	00:11:14.640	i don't want to disturb anyone.
C	00:11:14.640	00:11:27.509	i think victor and i need to lead separate lives,victor needs his freedom.
C	00:11:27.519	00:11:36.790	i'm so upset,not everyone has the same character.
C	00:11:36.800	00:11:49.600	elena, you're timid and shy,victor's more reserved,not everyone is sociable and outgoing like me.
C	00:11:49.600	00:11:52.870	i'm too demanding.
A	00:11:52.880	00:11:54.639	now you're being dramatic.
C	00:11:54.639	00:12:00.150	i don't fit in here i'm leaving,i'm going to betty's.
B	00:12:00.160	00:12:02.959	upset does it mean sad.
A	00:12:02.959	00:12:07.120	yes,a combination of sad and angry.
B	00:12:07.120	00:12:11.360	perhaps you didn't like the new furniture victor but while you were away.
A	00:12:11.360	00:12:15.750	she said she liked the bookcase anyway you're not moving out don't be ridiculous.
B	00:12:15.760	00:12:18.000	where will you leave?
C	00:12:18.000	00:12:23.670	i'm going to stay with betty for a few weeks then i'll decide.
B	00:12:23.680	00:12:25.440	are you two fighting?
A	00:12:25.440	00:12:30.000	no well, we had an argument last night.
A	00:12:30.000	00:12:35.920	you just have to respect other people's decisions more that's all you don't have to move out.
B	00:12:35.920	00:12:41.692	i think victor is saying you just have to give him more space but you don't have to move a house to do that.
B	00:12:42.116	00:12:44.501	Agatha,it won't be the same without you here.
A	00:12:46.160	00:12:59.430	it's just sometimes you're stubborn and selfish but you're also very caring loyal generous funny.
B	00:12:59.440	00:13:01.200	funny like fun?
C	00:13:01.200	00:13:06.870	humorous i'm demanding and bossy too right?
B	00:13:06.880	00:13:10.230	listen, you two, i think we all have to calm down.
B	00:13:10.240	00:13:16.480	i don't understand all the words you're using but insulting each other is not going to help victor.
B	00:13:16.480	00:13:23.110	you have a lot to do and i am sure you've been a little anxious recently.
A	00:13:23.120	00:13:27.590	sorry, agatha when i'm studying for exams i become very nervous.
A	00:13:27.600	00:13:30.240	this is an important time for me.
B	00:13:30.240	00:13:40.069	see, agatha he's apologizing and i'm sure he's going to be kind and understanding from now on.

A	00:13:40.079	00:13:44.470	did you get caught in the rain is it still raining?
