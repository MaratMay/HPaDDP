A	00:03:24.560	00:03:25.920	that's right!
D	00:03:25.920	00:03:28.949	lunar new year isn't just a chinese holiday?
D	00:03:28.959	00:03:30.560	did you know that?
D	00:03:30.560	00:03:35.840	many other asian countries also celebrate new year's on the same day.
A	00:03:35.840	00:03:37.440	yes!
A	00:03:37.440	00:03:39.750	max, how do you know all this?
D	00:03:39.760	00:03:45.840	when i cook foods from different countries, i like to learn about the culture, too.
D	00:03:45.840	00:03:49.200	i love reading about other cultures and foods.
A	00:03:49.200	00:03:51.030	cool!
A	00:03:51.040	00:03:55.110	chinese called their new year chunjie.
A	00:03:55.120	00:03:57.260	and koreans call theirs Seollal.

D	00:04:00.400	00:04:03.280	but i don't know much about their traditions.
D	00:04:03.280	00:04:04.789	do you?
A	00:04:04.799	00:04:07.040	i know some traditions.
D	00:04:07.040	00:04:11.190	do all three holidays have the same traditions?
A	00:04:11.200	00:04:13.439	they have similar traditions.
A	00:04:13.439	00:04:17.919	in all three countries, people eat a big meal with their families.
D	00:04:17.919	00:04:19.749	cool tradition.
D	00:04:19.759	00:04:22.870	so what are some of the differences?
A	00:04:22.880	00:04:24.639	the food is different.
A	00:04:24.639	00:04:28.000	koreans enjoy rice cake soup.
A	00:04:28.000	00:04:31.680	vietnamese eats sticky rice with meat.
A	00:04:31.680	00:04:33.430	it's wrapped in leaves.
D	00:04:33.440	00:04:35.840	i want to try to make that!
A	00:04:35.840	00:04:38.160	let's stop talking about food.
A	00:04:38.160	00:04:39.749	i'm getting hungry!
D	00:04:39.759	00:04:44.310	i'll cook some new year's food for us.

E	00:04:44.320	00:04:47.040	betty picks up a stuffed rat.
E	00:04:47.040	00:04:52.310	she gives the rat to sarah because it's the year of the rat.
E	00:04:52.320	00:04:55.430	sarah has a gift for betty, too.
E	00:04:55.440	00:05:01.600	betty is happy but a little confused when she sees the gift.
E	00:05:01.600	00:05:05.270	she isn't sure what the gift is.
F	00:05:05.280	00:05:09.430	thanks! uh, what is it?
A	00:05:09.440	00:05:12.870	it's a chinese paper lantern.
A	00:05:12.880	00:05:14.400	it's flat now.
A	00:05:14.400	00:05:18.150	pick up the top and it opens up.

F	00:05:28.400	00:05:31.990	chicago? that's far.
F	00:05:32.000	00:05:35.909	you must have driven a long time.
A	00:05:35.919	00:05:38.000	it took us two hours.
A	00:05:38.000	00:05:40.400	it's ok,we had fun.
F	00:05:40.400	00:05:43.350	well, that's good.
A	00:05:43.360	00:05:47.919	we ate a lunar new year's eve dinner in chinatown.
F	00:05:47.919	00:05:52.230	i've always wanted to go to chinatown.

A	00:06:11.039	00:06:12.960	i don't think so!
A	00:06:12.960	00:06:17.870	i think max cooks the best chinese food!

E	00:06:18.880	00:06:21.520	renee listens to them.
E	00:06:21.520	00:06:25.520	they are talking about max's daily special.
E	00:06:25.520	00:06:27.840	simon doesn't like it.
E	00:06:27.840	00:06:30.319	max isn't happy about that.
E	00:06:30.319	00:06:32.319	he loves his food.
E	00:06:32.319	00:06:34.240	renee smiles.
E	00:06:34.240	00:06:37.280	she walks over to max and simon.

B	00:09:49.200	00:09:51.920	i think that's a great idea!
B	00:09:51.920	00:09:54.630	we do have our own culture here.
B	00:09:54.640	00:09:57.360	we can have all kinds of events.
B	00:09:57.360	00:10:01.200	we can have a fast talking contest.
A	00:10:01.200	00:10:03.509	betty would win.
B	00:10:03.519	00:10:05.360	you're right.

B	00:10:16.880	00:10:21.600	ben, a restaurant is not the best place for those!
B	00:10:21.600	00:10:24.399	and why do you have them?
G	00:10:24.399	00:10:27.030	they're for the cockroach races.
G	00:10:27.040	00:10:32.320	you did say we could have all kinds of events.
B	00:10:32.320	00:10:34.630	that's true.
B	00:10:34.640	00:10:39.680	it would be an interesting way to celebrate small town.
