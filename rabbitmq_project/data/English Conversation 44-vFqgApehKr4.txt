H	00:05:52.264	00:05:53.193	well, i'll just stop here.
H	00:05:53.760	00:05:54.471	won't be long.
D	00:06:04.702	00:06:06.382	turn right here that'll be the quickest way.
D	00:06:26.827	00:06:28.440	come on you're blocking the street.
H	00:06:28.942	00:06:29.992	we won't be a minute.
D	00:06:30.310	00:06:31.611	can't you move any faster.
D	00:06:39.808	00:06:40.387	allow me.

H	00:07:07.845	00:07:09.845	so i stopped in the middle of the street.
H	00:07:10.725	00:07:19.929	while i was helping mrs burns out of the car,another car pulled up behind me and the driver of the car beeped his horn at me.
B	00:07:20.716	00:07:22.011	some people!
H	00:07:22.727	00:07:25.338	and poor old mrs burns can't move very fast.
H	00:07:25.921	00:07:31.126	so while we were walking to her door, the young man started shouting at us.
B	00:07:31.172	00:07:32.656	that's terrible!
H	00:07:32.766	00:07:37.063	and then he grabbed the suitcases from the car and he just dumped them on the pavement.
B	00:07:37.227	00:07:38.048	how rude!
H	00:07:39.172	00:07:43.283	but you know, i'm sure i've seen him somewhere before.
