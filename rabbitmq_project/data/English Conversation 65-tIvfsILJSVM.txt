B	00:09:17.839	00:09:22.120	the folders, pencils, pens, etc. are here in this cupboard.
B	00:09:23.120	00:09:26.640	and, i also have two chairs.
D	00:09:26.640	00:09:27.120	oh, good!
D	00:09:27.120	00:09:27.990	are these for everyone?
B	00:09:28.000	00:09:29.279	no, they are not!
B	00:09:29.279	00:09:31.839	don't touch anything, please!
D	00:09:31.839	00:09:35.509	okay, so you say you have all of the office supplies?
B	00:09:35.519	00:09:37.680	no, not really.
B	00:09:37.680	00:09:39.990	there isn't a fax machine.
B	00:09:40.000	00:09:43.590	there aren't all the programs i need on my computer.
D	00:09:43.600	00:09:47.190	and i guess you have an answering machine, is it useful?
B	00:09:47.200	00:09:49.680	i don't need an answering machine.
B	00:09:49.680	00:09:51.550	i answer the telephone myself.
D	00:09:52.560	00:09:53.839	okay, you're right.
D	00:09:53.839	00:09:59.279	this office is nice, and if you need a fax machine i have one in my apartment.
B	00:09:59.279	00:10:00.870	oh, thank you!
D	00:10:00.880	00:10:02.480	wait a minute!
D	00:10:02.480	00:10:03.670	something is missing.
D	00:10:05.680	00:10:07.200	where's the coffee machine?
D	00:10:07.200	00:10:09.030	all offices have a coffee machine.
B	00:10:09.040	00:10:12.000	i'm afraid there isn't one here.
B	00:10:12.000	00:10:16.240	there's a staff kitchen on the other side of the house,
B	00:10:16.240	00:10:17.839	in the kitchen!
B	00:10:17.839	00:10:19.110	we can have some coffee there.
D	00:10:19.120	00:10:20.710	good idea!

B	00:10:22.720	00:10:25.430	do you want milk with your coffee?
B	00:10:25.440	00:10:27.600	there's a bottle in the back of the fridge.
D	00:10:27.600	00:10:31.720	i prefer it without milk, but with some sugar.
B	00:10:32.720	00:10:36.230	oh, i'm afraid there isn't any sugar.
D	00:10:36.240	00:10:37.920	well, that's okay.
D	00:10:37.920	00:10:40.640	black coffee is good, too.
D	00:10:40.640	00:10:42.870	do you have any of those great cookies?
B	00:10:42.880	00:10:45.069	oh, yes!

D	00:11:23.600	00:11:25.600	these cookies are fantastic.
D	00:11:25.600	00:11:27.829	are there any more?
B	00:11:27.839	00:11:29.920	there're some more in the box.

B	00:11:36.320	00:11:41.790	hey! take your dirty napkin away from my kitchen!

B	00:11:48.800	00:11:53.590	yes, i always go shopping on saturdays.
B	00:11:53.600	00:11:57.590	the first thing i do on saturday is drive to the supermarket.
E	00:11:59.600	00:12:06.310	i sometimes go shopping on saturdays, but usually i sleep late.
E	00:12:06.320	00:12:08.590	i'm always so tired on saturdays.
C	00:12:09.600	00:12:12.000	i'm never tired on the weekend!
C	00:12:12.000	00:12:14.389	the weekend is a time for fun!
C	00:12:14.399	00:12:19.440	i paint, go jogging, go out with some friends.
C	00:12:19.440	00:12:23.110	unfortunately, i sometimes have to study.
B	00:12:23.120	00:12:26.959	oh, i sometimes do a little work at the weekend.
B	00:12:26.959	00:12:36.160	when i'm free i like going swimming, going to exhibitions or to concerts, if i have enough money.
B	00:12:36.160	00:12:39.600	oh! and every sunday,
B	00:12:39.600	00:12:44.069	i clean up the entire flat.
B	00:12:44.079	00:12:46.720	and in the evening i watch tv.
E	00:12:46.720	00:12:48.639	oh i never watch tv.
E	00:12:48.639	00:12:50.269	it's boring.
E	00:12:51.279	00:12:54.790	peter and i like going to the cinema at the weekend.
D	00:12:54.800	00:12:58.720	yes, it's important not to watch too much tv.
D	00:12:58.720	00:13:02.150	an hour a day or so, that's enough.
C	00:13:02.160	00:13:05.639	come on guys! you talk like my grandfather!
C	00:13:06.639	00:13:10.710	work, tv, housework on the weekends.
C	00:13:10.720	00:13:12.399	life is more!
A	00:13:12.399	00:13:18.160	i want you to take me to places where young people have fun!
C	00:13:18.160	00:13:21.040	great! get ready, grandpa!
A	00:13:21.040	00:13:24.240	work is so hard, guys.
A	00:13:24.240	00:13:32.079	i wake up at six thirty every day, have breakfast and take the train to work.
A	00:13:32.079	00:13:33.269	every day!
B	00:13:33.279	00:13:34.959	i know!
B	00:13:34.959	00:13:36.870	i get up at seven.
B	00:13:36.880	00:13:40.720	but i have a friend at work who usually gets up at six.
A	00:13:40.720	00:13:41.760	why?
A	00:13:41.760	00:13:44.230	that's too early.
B	00:13:44.240	00:13:46.870	it takes him an hour to drive to work.
A	00:13:46.880	00:13:49.240	wow, that's a long drive.
B	00:13:50.240	00:13:54.949	yes, but he lives in the country.
B	00:13:54.959	00:13:57.440	i think he's lucky.
B	00:13:57.440	00:14:01.030	every weekend he can go for walks in the woods.
B	00:14:01.040	00:14:03.440	not in traffic jams.
A	00:14:03.440	00:14:05.670	i guess that's pretty nice.
A	00:14:05.680	00:14:10.150	he lives in the countryside but works in the city.
A	00:14:10.160	00:14:14.150	a pretty nice combination.
B	00:14:14.160	00:14:16.079	what about you, sharon?
E	00:14:16.079	00:14:18.629	what time do you wake up?
E	00:14:18.639	00:14:21.750	i usually get up at about nine o'clock.
E	00:14:21.760	00:14:23.760	but i live in the city.
E	00:14:23.760	00:14:25.590	it's easy to get to work.
D	00:14:25.600	00:14:28.560	yes, but you get home very late.
D	00:14:28.560	00:14:31.430	often six thirty or seven.
E	00:14:31.440	00:14:36.310	you know i sometimes have five or six groups of tourists a day.
D	00:14:36.320	00:14:39.030	you work too much, my dear.
E	00:14:41.040	00:14:43.470	and you sing too much, peter.
A	00:14:46.480	00:14:52.240	alice, i bet you don't wake up at six o'clock every day.
A	00:14:52.240	00:14:56.320	tell us something about your typical day at university.
C	00:14:56.320	00:15:02.320	well, i sometimes have classes in the morning, but i usually have classes in the afternoon.
C	00:15:02.320	00:15:05.670	on mondays i always attend lectures in the morning.
A	00:15:05.680	00:15:07.519	and where do you study?
C	00:15:07.519	00:15:12.629	i usually study in the library, but i sometimes study at home, too.
C	00:15:12.639	00:15:15.509	when i don't have classes in the morning.
D	00:15:15.519	00:15:19.279	my friend david also studies at your university.
D	00:15:19.279	00:15:20.959	do you remember him?
C	00:15:20.959	00:15:22.949	david leary?
C	00:15:22.959	00:15:28.230	yes, i occasionally see him in the library, and sometimes in the park.
D	00:15:28.240	00:15:30.000	in the park?
D	00:15:30.000	00:15:31.910	doing what?
C	00:15:31.920	00:15:33.759	he likes studying there.
C	00:15:33.759	00:15:38.310	he takes his books, finds a nice park bench and reads there.
D	00:15:38.320	00:15:39.759	not a bad idea.
D	00:15:39.759	00:15:43.990	you can study and enjoy nature at the same time.
C	00:15:44.000	00:15:47.430	yes, i like the park, too.
C	00:15:47.440	00:15:51.749	unfortunately, i often need books that are in the library.
A	00:15:51.759	00:15:53.680	and what about lunch?
A	00:15:53.680	00:15:57.759	do you usually make sandwiches and take them with you?
C	00:15:57.759	00:16:01.519	oh no, i hate cooking.
C	00:16:01.519	00:16:05.680	i usually have lunch in the cafeteria, with friends.
E	00:16:05.680	00:16:07.839	oh. i do just the opposite.
E	00:16:07.839	00:16:10.230	i usually cook lunch at home.
E	00:16:10.240	00:16:13.839	i seldom have a quick lunch at coffee shops.
A	00:16:13.839	00:16:18.880	okay guys. stop with this boring talk.
A	00:16:18.880	00:16:21.040	what about fun?
A	00:16:21.040	00:16:26.749	do any of you do anything besides working and studying?
A	00:16:27.759	00:16:30.269	it's friday, remember!
B	00:16:31.279	00:16:33.440	you're right, jack.

A	00:16:43.440	00:16:45.269	let me ask you a question, alice?
C	00:16:45.279	00:16:48.079	sure, ask any question you like, i'm an open book.
A	00:16:48.079	00:16:50.069	do you have a boyfriend?
C	00:16:50.079	00:16:57.030	well, i go out with some boys, but that's nothing serious.
C	00:16:57.040	00:16:59.920	according to my birth chart,
C	00:16:59.920	00:17:07.110	i need some taurines, but that's not easy now that saturn is in leo.
A	00:17:07.120	00:17:08.799	i see.
A	00:17:08.799	00:17:11.909	anyway i think you have a strange relationship with boys.
C	00:17:11.919	00:17:13.600	oh, no!
C	00:17:13.600	00:17:16.959	i like boys very much!
C	00:17:16.959	00:17:19.360	they're great at carrying packages.
A	00:17:19.360	00:17:21.760	you're exceptional.
C	00:17:21.760	00:17:23.520	thanks, jack.

C	00:17:32.559	00:17:38.070	no really, i'm curious, what do you do at work?
A	00:17:38.080	00:17:40.240	oh, nothing special.

A	00:18:04.400	00:18:08.789	and keep them informed about new product lines, and take care of their requests.
C	00:18:08.799	00:18:10.400	what kind of requests do they have?
C	00:18:10.400	00:18:14.400	oh, they often ask questions about new models and prices.

A	00:18:23.520	00:18:28.310	well, seriously speaking, it depends, each client is different.
A	00:18:28.320	00:18:29.679	if they're important.
A	00:18:29.679	00:18:32.470	i try to make an agreement with them.
