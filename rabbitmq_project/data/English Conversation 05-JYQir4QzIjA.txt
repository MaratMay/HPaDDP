D	00:27:50.959	00:27:54.670	that sounds like a very nice way to start the day
O	00:27:54.670	00:28:00.949	from there a van takes you on a brief tour of the dog downtown shopping district.
O	00:28:00.949	00:28:06.400	and points out some of the highlights and unique shops.
O	00:28:06.400	00:28:11.980	that lasts until about ten o'clock when we stop for coffee at the cafe George.
