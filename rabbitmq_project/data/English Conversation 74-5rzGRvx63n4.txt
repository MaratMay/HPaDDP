A	00:14:39.920	00:14:42.240	you have a great ability to summarize.
A	00:14:43.360	00:14:48.470	you know, mr. richardson, we aren't very pleased with our current typographers.
A	00:14:48.480	00:14:49.990	they don't meet deadlines.
E	00:14:50.000	00:14:56.000	professionalism, efficiency, and punctuality are the keys to our success!

E	00:15:21.680	00:15:27.199	young lady, you work for a publishing house and you don't know what offset printing is?
B	00:15:28.320	00:15:31.543	no, sir, i'm afraid i don't.
B	00:15:32.399	00:15:33.680	is it important?
A	00:15:33.680	00:15:46.160	anne, offset printing is the classic way in which a graphic project done on a computer is converted to the final printed page.
B	00:15:46.160	00:15:47.590	i get it!
B	00:15:47.600	00:15:48.720	i get it!
B	00:15:48.720	00:15:52.120	well, it is important, it's extremely important!
B	00:15:53.120	00:15:55.990	what an idiot i must seem...
B	00:15:56.000	00:16:00.949	i basically told you i have no technological know-how!
B	00:16:00.959	00:16:08.580	you know, mr. stevens, i am studying the editor's manual that you gave me, but... but i i haven't got to the letter 'o' yet!
