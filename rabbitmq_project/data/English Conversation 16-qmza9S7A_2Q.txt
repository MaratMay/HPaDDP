B	00:10:58.640	00:10:59.120	why?

B	00:11:29.200	00:11:32.389	but they corrected the problem right.
C	00:11:32.399	00:11:33.200	yes.
C	00:11:33.232	00:11:37.781	finally, they blamed it on a computer error.

E	00:11:45.600	00:11:46.880	hurry up!

F	00:11:52.959	00:11:56.959	or i think maybe i packed them in the blue suitcase.
E	00:11:56.959	00:12:03.040	you mean the suitcase that we checked in at the counter.
E	00:12:03.040	00:12:06.320	i'm sure they weren't in that one.
