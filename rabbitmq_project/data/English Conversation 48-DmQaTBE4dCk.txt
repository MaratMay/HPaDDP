H	00:24:10.707	00:24:14.363	I guess there are lots of things we don't know about each other.
F	00:24:14.363	00:24:23.319	Hey in your song you promise to always be honest with me did you really mean that?

H	00:24:52.477	00:24:57.971	that's okay Ali I understand I'm not sure I'm ready to date either.

H	00:25:12.920	00:25:18.710	it's better to take things slowly that way we can be careful not to hurt each other.
F	00:25:18.710	00:25:22.517	right so what do we do now?
H	00:25:22.517	00:25:27.139	well let's keep getting to know each other better as friends.
F	00:25:27.139	00:25:28.530	that's a good idea.
H	00:25:28.530	00:25:33.377	and then maybe in a few months if we're still interested.
F	00:25:33.377	00:25:35.290	we can start dating?
H	00:25:35.300	00:25:36.590	exactly.
I	00:25:36.590	00:25:45.420	that sounds good to me and in case you're wondering don't worry I'll still be interested.
H	00:25:45.430	00:25:48.420	I hope so.
