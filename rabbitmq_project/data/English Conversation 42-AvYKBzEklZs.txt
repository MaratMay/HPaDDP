A	00:00:05.796	00:00:07.467	what do you want this chair,jane?
A	00:00:08.010	00:00:10.099	by the window or in the corner over there?
B	00:00:12.719	00:00:16.640	Ally it's a lovely flat, and this is a very pleasant street.
C	00:00:16.640	00:00:18.160	what did you say the neighbors were like?
B	00:00:18.160	00:00:20.000	oh, don't worry, they're all lovely.
B	00:00:20.000	00:00:23.039	you're going to be very happy here.
B	00:00:23.039	00:00:32.150	here, let me give you a hand.
A	00:00:32.160	00:00:35.120	why did you want to move in here?
D	00:00:35.120	00:00:38.069	i've told you a hundred times, Matt.
D	00:00:38.079	00:00:39.440	i needed a change.
A	00:00:39.440	00:00:41.270	but i don't understand.
A	00:00:41.280	00:00:44.470	you had a great room at Helen's house.
D	00:00:44.480	00:00:46.000	and more space.
A	00:00:46.000	00:00:48.229	but you haven't got more space here.
A	00:00:48.239	00:00:51.910	by the time all your stuff's in, it's going to feel really cramped.
A	00:00:51.920	00:00:55.750	and you're moving in with your sister!

C	00:00:55.760	00:00:58.399	this water heater looks a bit old, mr Usher.
B	00:00:58.399	00:00:59.150	call me Eddie.
C	00:01:00.160	00:01:01.600	is it reliable?
B	00:01:01.600	00:01:02.879	reliable?
B	00:01:02.879	00:01:06.250	it's top quality, Ali.

D	00:01:10.159	00:01:12.000	i'm sorry, Matt.
D	00:01:12.000	00:01:15.439	the whole thing between us was a mistake.
D	00:01:15.439	00:01:17.429	a moment of madness.
A	00:01:17.439	00:01:18.320	it wasn't.
A	00:01:18.320	00:01:20.870	i love you.
D	00:01:20.880	00:01:22.080	and i love you, too.
D	00:01:22.080	00:01:25.510	but not like that.
D	00:01:25.520	00:01:28.159	i think i was feeling sorry for you...
D	00:01:28.159	00:01:36.390	and that's not really the basis for a relationship, is it?
B	00:01:36.400	00:01:38.789	everything's in perfect working order.
B	00:01:38.799	00:01:41.350	any problems, i'm only a phone call away.
B	00:01:41.360	00:01:42.640	here's my card.
C	00:01:43.040	00:01:44.710	thanks.
C	00:01:44.720	00:01:46.720	but this is only for office hours.
C	00:01:46.720	00:01:49.749	isn't there a twenty-four hour emergency service?
B	00:01:49.759	00:01:51.840	Ali, do me a favor!
B	00:01:51.840	00:02:00.310	on this rent?

A	00:02:00.320	00:02:02.240	just give me one more chance.
D	00:02:02.240	00:02:03.655	Matt, please...
D	00:02:05.718	00:02:10.714	oh, oh!oh no!
A	00:02:10.800	00:02:11.825	that was my fault.
A	00:02:11.760	00:02:13.360	i'm really sorry.
D	00:02:13.360	00:02:14.640	no, it wasn't!
A	00:02:14.640	00:02:17.190	yes, it was!
E	00:02:17.200	00:02:19.599	what the hell's going on down there?

E	00:02:26.879	00:02:30.239	and i got back from new york at six o'clock this morning!
E	00:02:30.239	00:02:36.570	so can you try to keep the noise down?

B	00:02:45.200	00:02:47.120	is this your guitar, Jane?
D	00:02:47.120	00:02:48.309	what?
D	00:02:48.319	00:02:49.760	no, it isn't.
A	00:02:49.760	00:02:51.040	it's mine.
A	00:02:51.040	00:02:53.670	i'm off to a rehearsal now with my band.

A	00:02:55.760	00:02:58.470	well, you don't know everything about me.
D	00:02:58.480	00:03:00.879	obviously not.
B	00:03:00.879	00:03:04.149	you can't judge a book by its cover.
B	00:03:04.159	00:03:05.840	now, i'd like to hear you play.
B	00:03:05.840	00:03:08.390	have you got any gigs planned?
A	00:03:08.400	00:03:11.830	no, we haven't, not yet.
A	00:03:11.840	00:03:15.270	we're waiting for the right moment.
B	00:03:15.280	00:03:17.760	good for you.

A	00:03:46.159	00:03:48.869	i'll see if i can get it repaired.
B	00:03:48.879	00:03:50.720	that's beyond repair, mate.

C	00:04:11.599	00:04:13.680	are you all coming to see our new flat?

G	00:04:43.840	00:04:44.639	money?
G	00:04:44.639	00:04:46.240	how much?
G	00:04:46.240	00:04:49.990	i could possibly manage five pounds.
A	00:04:50.000	00:04:51.759	two hundred.
G	00:04:51.759	00:04:52.639	two hundred pounds?
G	00:04:52.639	00:04:53.909	you must be joking!
G	00:04:53.919	00:04:56.310	what on earth do you want two hundred pounds for?

G	00:05:09.520	00:05:10.720	is the rent cheap?
C	00:05:10.720	00:05:13.280	hardly! but the landlord thinks it is.
D	00:05:13.280	00:05:18.560	well, we are renting the whole flat, not just a room.
F	00:05:18.560	00:05:19.830	maybe that's Simon.
C	00:05:19.840	00:05:22.560	i'll go.
D	00:05:22.560	00:05:25.029	how are things with Simon?
F	00:05:25.039	00:05:27.039	i don't know.
F	00:05:27.039	00:05:29.670	he's always busy.
F	00:05:29.680	00:05:33.189	i never see him.
D	00:05:33.199	00:05:35.680	what's that?
A	00:05:35.680	00:05:38.479	i brought you a housewarming present.
D	00:05:38.479	00:05:40.800	oh Matt...
D	00:05:40.800	00:05:42.710	it looks really expensive.
G	00:05:42.720	00:05:46.870	yeah, it's cost a fortune.
D	00:05:46.880	00:05:49.560	Simon! champion- flowers!
H	00:05:50.467	00:05:51.027	right.

F	00:05:53.520	00:05:55.039	that's okay.
F	00:05:55.039	00:05:56.390	that's really thoughtful of you.
H	00:05:56.400	00:05:58.880	yeah, but... uh they're not from me.
H	00:05:58.880	00:06:00.230	i found them outside the door.
C	00:06:00.240	00:06:01.099	hang on a sec.
C	00:06:01.121	00:06:04.710	there's a note.
C	00:06:04.720	00:06:06.240	it's from Bill.
F	00:06:06.240	00:06:09.350	who's Bill?
C	00:06:09.360	00:06:11.360	i'm so sorry i was rude earlier.
C	00:06:11.360	00:06:13.830	i was really very jet-lagged.
C	00:06:13.840	00:06:17.029	welcome to your new home.
D	00:06:17.039	00:06:18.720	the guy upstairs!
A	00:06:18.720	00:06:21.280	what, that grumpy american?
C	00:06:21.280	00:06:23.440	well, he can't be that grumpy, can he?

C	00:06:29.919	00:06:31.520	hello. see you in a bit.

D	00:06:33.600	00:06:37.160	hi, Helen, i'm so sorry i'm late.
F	00:06:37.293	00:06:37.919	it's all right.
F	00:06:37.919	00:06:39.280	your hair looks wet.
F	00:06:39.280	00:06:41.510	i didn't know it was raining.
F	00:06:41.520	00:06:43.199	it's not.
F	00:06:43.199	00:06:45.990	i had a bit of an accident.
F	00:06:46.000	00:06:47.680	you are okay?
D	00:06:47.680	00:06:49.589	yeah i'm fine.
D	00:06:49.599	00:06:51.885	the long story i'll tell you later.
D	00:06:52.605	00:06:53.299	what about you?
D	00:06:53.343	00:06:55.054	you sounded really worried on the phone.
D	00:06:54.800	00:06:56.790	what's wrong?
F	00:06:56.800	00:06:59.440	everything.
D	00:06:59.440	00:07:01.510	why?
F	00:07:01.520	00:07:03.759	Matt's changed since you left.
F	00:07:03.759	00:07:08.550	he used to be so quiet, asleep most of the time, half asleep the rest of it.
F	00:07:08.560	00:07:11.440	but now he's taken up the guitar.
D	00:07:11.440	00:07:15.510	yeah, he's joined some kind of band, hasn't he?
D	00:07:15.520	00:07:17.029	what are they like?
F	00:07:17.039	00:07:18.400	i haven't heard them.
F	00:07:18.400	00:07:21.670	but he's appalling.
F	00:07:21.680	00:07:24.150	and i don't know what to do about Simon.
F	00:07:24.160	00:07:26.150	it's getting worse.
F	00:07:26.160	00:07:29.110	he's just not interested in me anymore.
F	00:07:29.120	00:07:31.029	he's always doing something else.
F	00:07:31.039	00:07:33.430	take last tuesday...
F	00:07:39.039	00:07:41.039	i'd been waiting outside the cinema...
F	00:07:41.039	00:07:45.650	for over half an hour before he turned up.
H	00:07:45.980	00:07:57.589	Hi, pet! everything all right?
F	00:07:57.599	00:08:00.869	it was really looking forward to seeing this film.
F	00:08:00.879	00:08:04.145	but it had only just started when his mobile rang.
H	00:08:14.301	00:08:14.835	Hello Matt! 
H	00:08:16.302	00:08:16.919	wow! 
H	00:08:17.760	00:08:23.902	ok, yeah,i'm really sorry, pet, but i've got to go.
F	00:08:23.916	00:08:25.222	but what about the film?
H	00:08:25.360	00:08:26.639	tell me how it ends.
H	00:08:26.796	00:08:27.632	i'll call you later.
F	00:08:34.640	00:08:37.120	it's been like this for weeks.
F	00:08:37.120	00:08:41.909	i think he's seeing someone else.
F	00:08:41.919	00:08:44.000	you listening?
D	00:08:44.000	00:08:45.430	what?
D	00:08:45.440	00:08:46.800	that's terrible.
D	00:08:46.800	00:08:49.430	you should tell him to turn down the volume.
F	00:08:49.440	00:08:50.720	who?
D	00:08:50.674	00:08:51.371	Matt.
F	00:08:51.763	00:08:52.665	Matt?
F	00:08:54.720	00:08:58.710	thanks. that's really helpful.
F	00:08:58.720	00:09:00.480	so what happened to you?
F	00:09:00.480	00:09:02.630	you said you had some sort of accident.
D	00:09:02.640	00:09:06.470	well, it involves our new neighbor.
C	00:09:06.480	00:09:07.680	Bill, the american?

D	00:09:22.800	00:09:25.220	i fancied a relaxing evening.
D	00:09:29.040	00:09:30.720	so i made the flat nice...
D	00:09:30.720	00:09:40.430	and decided to have a shower.

D	00:10:37.680	00:10:39.509	yeah, it was me.
D	00:10:39.519	00:10:42.480	when i got in the shower, the water was freezing.
D	00:10:42.480	00:10:46.069	i think the water heater's broken down.
E	00:10:46.079	00:10:49.190	you're not an electrician by any chance?
E	00:10:49.200	00:10:53.750	well, i am a scientist, although i work in pharmaceuticals, actually.
E	00:10:53.760	00:10:55.111	have you got a screwdriver?
E	00:10:55.129	00:10:55.974	and a flashlight?
D	00:10:57.040	00:10:58.720	oh, you mean a torch.
E	00:10:58.720	00:11:00.550	is that what they call it over here?
D	00:11:00.560	00:11:03.200	yeah... but i haven't got one.
E	00:11:03.200	00:11:05.710	okay, i'll go and get mine.
E	00:11:10.079	00:11:11.760	this is appalling.
E	00:11:11.760	00:11:15.279	it was put in years ago.
E	00:11:15.279	00:11:17.680	can you turn off the main switch?
D	00:11:17.680	00:11:21.590	oh, yeah.
E	00:11:21.600	00:11:24.320	it's probably in the hall.
D	00:11:24.320	00:11:30.230	yeah, right, of course.
E	00:11:30.240	00:11:34.949	next to the fuse box... under the stairs.
D	00:11:34.959	00:11:36.720	okay.
D	00:11:36.720	00:11:38.949	just as i was going to look for the main switch...
D	00:11:38.959	00:11:40.320	the phone rang again.
D	00:11:40.320	00:11:41.120	it was you.
D	00:11:41.120	00:11:43.190	hi, Helen. what are you up to?
F	00:11:43.200	00:11:46.630	i'm standing outside freud's and waiting for Simon!
F	00:11:46.640	00:11:47.600	can we talk?
D	00:11:47.600	00:11:52.079	of course. shall i come and meet you there, say in half an hour?
D	00:11:52.079	00:11:54.389	i'm a bit busy at the moment.
F	00:11:54.399	00:11:56.000	thanks, Jane.
D	00:11:56.000	00:11:58.069	okay, bye.
E	00:11:58.079	00:11:59.519	are you done up there?
D	00:11:59.519	00:12:00.480	yep!
E	00:12:00.480	00:12:04.870	i think i can see the problem!
E	00:12:04.880	00:12:07.360	there's a loose wire.
E	00:12:07.360	00:12:13.990	can you hold the... torch for me?
E	00:12:14.000	00:12:19.190	unfortunately... the electricity hadn't been turned off.
F	00:12:19.200	00:12:22.310	what do you mean, the electricity hadn't been turned off?
F	00:12:22.320	00:12:24.000	you hadn't turned it off!
D	00:12:24.000	00:12:28.079	i know... and i felt terrible.
C	00:12:28.079	00:12:30.470	is Bill okay?
D	00:12:30.480	00:12:35.269	well...
E	00:12:35.279	00:12:37.279	hey, take it easy.
D	00:12:37.279	00:12:39.680	i am so sorry about this.
E	00:12:39.680	00:12:41.040	accidents happen.
E	00:12:41.040	00:12:42.949	it's no big deal.
E	00:12:42.959	00:12:45.030	but just wait till i talk to Eddie Usher.
E	00:12:45.040	00:12:47.990	that wiring is a disgrace.
E	00:12:48.000	00:12:50.079	Ow! what is that stuff?
D	00:12:50.079	00:12:55.509	it's a homeopathic cure.
E	00:12:55.519	00:13:02.949	unscientific, but it's good.
E	00:13:02.959	00:13:05.990	i guess you really like tv.
D	00:13:06.000	00:13:08.000	not especially, why?
E	00:13:08.000	00:13:11.350	well, that's a pretty impressive screen.
D	00:13:11.360	00:13:16.150	oh, what, it was given to me by Matt.
A	00:13:16.160	00:13:19.360	is that the guy i saw you with last sunday?
D	00:13:19.360	00:13:21.760	yeah...
E	00:13:21.760	00:13:23.430	is he your boyfriend?
D	00:13:23.440	00:13:30.230	no... ex-boyfriend.
F	00:13:30.240	00:13:32.240	and then what happened?
D	00:13:32.240	00:13:36.320	nothing. i came here and left him to mend the door.
C	00:13:36.320	00:13:37.500	you didn't?

D	00:14:16.560	00:14:17.920	for heaven's sake!
E	00:14:17.920	00:14:20.230	bike trouble?
D	00:14:20.240	00:14:23.040	yeah, this old thing's useless.
D	00:14:23.040	00:14:26.069	it was such a lovely day, i wanted to go for a ride in the country.
E	00:14:26.079	00:14:27.360	well, why don't you come with me?
E	00:14:27.360	00:14:30.790	i'm just about to go for a spin on my mg.
D	00:14:30.800	00:14:32.859	i should stay and sort this out.
E	00:14:32.884	00:14:35.350	yeah, i can fix that for you later. come on.
E	00:14:35.360	00:14:38.550	is that thing safe?
E	00:14:38.560	00:14:40.160	safe?
E	00:14:40.160	00:14:40.800	you mean like.
E	00:14:40.800	00:14:44.310	can it give you an electric shock?
D	00:14:44.320	00:14:47.590	i just meant it looks a bit on the antiquated side.
E	00:14:47.600	00:14:51.350	that is one of the finest sports cars ever made in britain!
E	00:14:51.360	00:14:52.720	so, you coming?
D	00:14:52.720	00:14:55.475	okay, have i got time to wash my hands?
E	00:14:55.486	00:14:55.884	sure.

B	00:15:04.639	00:15:13.269	cappuccino's all round, Ali!
B	00:15:13.279	00:15:17.910	okay, let's get down to business.
B	00:15:17.920	00:15:19.519	i liked your cd.
B	00:15:19.519	00:15:21.040	i think you boys are good.
B	00:15:21.040	00:15:25.199	i even think you might become quite big... if you get the brakes.
B	00:15:25.199	00:15:28.949	but listen. i'm only going to say this once.
B	00:15:28.959	00:15:31.839	you must get a new singer. got it?
H	00:15:31.839	00:15:33.110	what's wrong with Matt?
B	00:15:33.120	00:15:34.880	do i have to spell it out?
A	00:15:34.880	00:15:38.560	no,don't.
A	00:15:38.560	00:15:44.920	good,because you should always listen to your uncle Eddie.

E	00:15:49.199	00:15:52.550	so what do you think of my little old english sports car?
D	00:15:52.560	00:15:55.199	i love it.
E	00:15:55.199	00:15:58.710	i never understood why the british stopped making cars.
E	00:15:58.720	00:16:02.150	okay i i can understand pulling out a volume production....
E	00:16:02.160	00:16:04.480	because those cars could be made cheaper elsewhere.
E	00:16:04.480	00:16:15.110	but cars for niche markets the brits were the best.
D	00:16:15.120	00:16:16.240	sorry, Bill.
D	00:16:16.240	00:16:17.519	this won't take a second.
E	00:16:17.519	00:16:19.680	no problem.
D	00:16:19.680	00:16:26.320	hi Helen. lt's Jane.

B	00:16:26.320	00:16:28.800	you don't have to sign anything you don't want to.
B	00:16:28.800	00:16:31.110	but if we enter into a formal agreement...
B	00:16:31.120	00:16:33.003	i can give you boys a help in hand.
C	00:16:33.910	00:16:34.386	finished?
H	00:16:38.079	00:16:39.120	thanks Ali.
A	00:16:39.120	00:16:43.749	thanks.
H	00:16:43.759	00:16:46.240	what kind of help?
B	00:16:46.240	00:16:48.720	first off, i can fix you up with a gig.
A	00:16:48.720	00:16:49.519	a gig?
H	00:16:49.519	00:16:51.509	we could set up a gig for ourselves.
B	00:16:51.519	00:16:52.480	at the galaxy?
B	00:16:52.480	00:16:54.710	i don't think so.
H	00:16:54.720	00:16:56.000	what else?
B	00:16:56.000	00:16:59.600	let's put it this way, i'm seeing an old friend of mine this evening.
B	00:16:59.600	00:17:02.959	he signs up new acts for the top record companies.
B	00:17:02.959	00:17:05.679	i could ask him to come along to your show.
B	00:17:05.679	00:17:07.770	what do you say?
D	00:17:11.439	00:17:13.839	can you ride?
E	00:17:13.839	00:17:17.429	i may be an american but i'm no cowboy.
E	00:17:17.439	00:17:19.039	i guess you can.
D	00:17:19.039	00:17:21.110	yeah, i love it.
D	00:17:21.120	00:17:23.120	i learned to ride at drama school.
D	00:17:23.120	00:17:24.789	it was part of the training.
D	00:17:24.799	00:17:27.760	you know: speaking, singing, dancing, horse riding.
E	00:17:27.760	00:17:28.390	right.
E	00:17:28.400	00:17:31.200	so, do you do a lot of acting?
D	00:17:31.200	00:17:32.710	i wish.
D	00:17:32.720	00:17:34.640	i actually do a lot of teaching.
D	00:17:34.640	00:17:35.750	i've got to make a living.
E	00:17:35.760	00:17:39.430	sure.
D	00:17:39.440	00:17:41.440	do you like what you do?
E	00:17:41.440	00:17:43.510	well my job?
E	00:17:43.520	00:17:44.559	yeah.
E	00:17:44.559	00:17:46.270	the job's good.

B	00:17:57.411	00:17:58.806	there's no need to read the whole thing.
B	00:17:58.851	00:18:00.080	it's a standard agreement.
H	00:18:00.080	00:18:00.710	sorry.
H	00:18:00.720	00:18:01.722	i'll be back in a minute.
H	00:18:01.749	00:18:06.310	i just need to have a word with someone.
B	00:18:06.320	00:18:11.350	Girl trouble?
F	00:18:11.360	00:18:14.559	we're meeting at the low bar at about ten, so if you'd like to come along....
H	00:18:14.559	00:18:15.669	hi, Helen.
F	00:18:15.679	00:18:16.880	hi, Simon!
F	00:18:16.880	00:18:18.950	i didn't see you in here!
I	00:18:18.960	00:18:21.840	i'll catch you later.
H	00:18:21.840	00:18:24.000	is he a friend of yours?
F	00:18:24.000	00:18:28.559	oh yeah. well, sort of.
F	00:18:28.559	00:18:32.710	actually, i came in here to see Ali.
F	00:18:32.720	00:18:37.029	what are you doing here?
B	00:18:37.039	00:18:39.679	everything all right?
B	00:18:39.679	00:18:41.350	it's all totally above board, Matt.
B	00:18:41.360	00:18:44.140	you just have to sign here.
A	00:18:46.720	00:18:49.039	but what about Simon?
B	00:18:49.039	00:18:56.580	we only need one signature.
B	00:19:01.840	00:19:07.190	and your copy.
B	00:19:07.200	00:19:09.270	you won't regret this.
H	00:19:13.280	00:19:16.240	you know how Matt was really good about Jane.
H	00:19:16.240	00:19:18.609	well, this music thing's become really important to him...
H	00:19:18.609	00:19:21.430	and i just wanted to give him some support.
F	00:19:21.440	00:19:25.200	you mean all the secrecy is because of Matt?
F	00:19:25.200	00:19:27.120	but why didn't you tell me?
F	00:19:27.120	00:19:28.930	i thought you were seeing somebody else!
H	00:19:28.720	00:19:30.480	oh, sorry.
H	00:19:30.480	00:19:32.390	i just didn't think i could tell you.
H	00:19:32.400	00:19:35.200	i know you can't stand his music.
F	00:19:35.200	00:19:36.160	it isn't music.
H	00:19:36.160	00:19:37.760	well, Eddie thinks it is.
F	00:19:37.760	00:19:38.789	can you believe him?
H	00:19:38.799	00:19:49.909	no, but Matt does, and that's enough for me.
H	00:19:49.919	00:19:51.440	where's Eddie?
A	00:19:51.440	00:19:53.590	oh, he couldn't hang around.
B	00:19:53.600	00:19:57.210	he's a busy man!

E	00:20:00.880	00:20:04.310	you know, i haven't had this much fun in a long time.
D	00:20:04.320	00:20:06.640	me neither.
E	00:20:06.640	00:20:09.200	i'm getting to really like it here.
D	00:20:09.200	00:20:12.080	that's good!
E	00:20:12.080	00:20:18.230	the thing is, that might be going back to the states.
D	00:20:18.240	00:20:19.120	for work?
E	00:20:19.120	00:20:23.110	yeah. that's why i had to go back to new york...
E	00:20:23.120	00:20:25.830	just before you moved into the house.
E	00:20:25.840	00:20:28.240	i might be taking on something new.
E	00:20:28.240	00:20:29.350	it's not definite.
E	00:20:29.360	00:20:33.970	they're still making up their minds.

D	00:20:45.120	00:20:48.149	hi, Matt. what's up?
A	00:20:48.159	00:20:52.310	nothing. i was looking for Ali.
D	00:20:52.320	00:20:54.720	she's still at work, isn't she?
A	00:20:54.720	00:20:58.960	oh, yeah, right.
A	00:20:58.960	00:21:01.830	that doesn't look too good.
D	00:21:01.840	00:21:05.830	Yeah, the chain keeps coming off.
A	00:21:05.840	00:21:11.190	right. i'll see you then.
A	00:21:11.200	00:21:11.810	bye.
D	00:21:12.930	00:21:13.917	bye.

C	00:21:28.000	00:21:29.440	i'm off.
C	00:21:29.440	00:21:31.190	are you seeing Bill tonight?
D	00:21:31.200	00:21:33.440	yeah, but just for a drink.
C	00:21:33.440	00:21:36.000	nothing serious though then?
D	00:21:36.000	00:21:39.039	last thing i need right now is a relationship.
D	00:21:39.039	00:21:41.164	especially one where we could be waving at each other...
D	00:21:41.186	00:21:44.640	from opposite sides of the atlantic.
D	00:21:44.640	00:21:47.520	he's probably being transferred to new york.
C	00:21:47.520	00:21:50.230	oh, no!
D	00:21:50.240	00:21:54.720	oh yes.. which is why i'm taking a step back.
C	00:21:54.720	00:21:56.640	we should talk about this later.
D	00:21:56.640	00:21:57.919	yeah, sure.
D	00:21:58.094	00:21:58.663	see you.
C	00:21:58.797	00:21:59.606	bye!

G	00:22:16.720	00:22:20.741	oh sorry... uh... i'm a bit lost.
G	00:22:20.400	00:22:21.954	i'm trying to find a rehearsal room.
J	00:22:21.955	00:22:22.960	for the broken hearts?
J	00:22:22.960	00:22:25.430	are you going to the audition?
J	00:22:25.440	00:22:27.039	you don't look much like a singer.
G	00:22:27.132	00:22:27.404	me?
G	00:22:27.435	00:22:29.110	no, i'm a friend.
G	00:22:29.120	00:22:30.955	a friend and an advisor.
G	00:22:30.955	00:22:31.662	is that where you're going?
G	00:22:31.688	00:22:32.710	i can't find the number.
J	00:22:32.720	00:22:33.600	me neither.
J	00:22:33.600	00:22:35.350	i've never been here before.
G	00:22:35.360	00:22:45.510	hang on, i've got an idea.
A	00:22:45.520	00:22:47.039	hello?
G	00:22:47.039	00:22:48.080	Matt!
A	00:22:48.080	00:22:49.029	David hi!
A	00:22:49.039	00:22:50.559	just a minute, i'm taking a call...
G	00:22:50.559	00:22:51.089	Matt!
A	00:22:53.039	00:22:54.799	all right.
A	00:22:54.799	00:22:56.070	come in.
A	00:22:56.080	00:22:56.960	for the audition?
J	00:22:56.960	00:22:57.760	yeah.
A	00:22:57.760	00:22:58.720	great.
A	00:22:58.720	00:23:09.890	we're just this way.

A	00:23:29.520	00:23:35.510	i'm sure the contract's all right but you know what Helen's like.
A	00:23:35.520	00:23:38.480	and she's making Simon nervous, too.
G	00:23:38.480	00:23:40.310	you know, i'm doing a big favor here.
A	00:23:40.320	00:23:42.080	yeah, i really appreciate it.
G	00:23:42.080	00:23:44.870	i mean, i normally charge for legal advice....
G	00:23:44.880	00:23:50.870	and i doubt that you could afford my hourly rate!
A	00:23:50.880	00:23:51.820	and you are?
K	00:23:51.882	00:23:52.273	Iggy.
A	00:23:54.640	00:23:56.400	great!
A	00:23:56.400	00:23:58.080	we're not quite ready at the moment.
A	00:23:58.080	00:24:00.517	uh why don't you take a seat?
K	00:24:01.207	00:24:01.679	whatever.
F	00:24:06.480	00:24:08.640	David, just one thing.
F	00:24:08.640	00:24:10.870	it's okay to video the candidates, isn't it?
A	00:24:10.880	00:24:14.149	candidates? it's not a job interview.
F	00:24:14.159	00:24:15.279	David?
G	00:24:15.279	00:24:19.029	as long as you don't use the video for commercial purposes, it's fine.
A	00:24:19.039	00:24:20.640	that's what i said.
F	00:24:20.640	00:24:24.799	that's brilliant, thanks for your help, David.
G	00:24:24.799	00:24:26.739	you know, you still owe me the two hundred pounds...
G	00:24:26.739	00:24:28.214	i lent you for Jane's tv.
A	00:24:28.240	00:24:30.480	i haven't forgotten it.
A	00:24:30.480	00:24:33.430	i'll start paying you back after our gig.
A	00:24:33.440	00:24:39.909	you're a real mate.
A	00:24:39.919	00:24:43.510	okay, Melissa, can you tell us something about yourself?
J	00:24:43.520	00:24:49.840	sure. uh my name's Melissa, but i guess you all know that by now...
J	00:24:49.840	00:24:52.880	and i've always wanted to be a singer in a band.
J	00:24:52.880	00:24:54.879	in fact, i've been in a band...
J	00:24:54.879	00:24:57.590	and our records have sold all over the world.
A	00:24:57.600	00:24:59.120	really?
J	00:24:59.120	00:25:03.440	you know, i had a number twenty-seven hit in norway...
J	00:25:03.440	00:25:06.310	and got into the top a hundred in luxembourg.
J	00:25:06.320	00:25:09.269	and we were pretty successful for about two years.
J	00:25:09.279	00:25:11.760	but then it all went wrong.
J	00:25:11.760	00:25:13.430	our manager was sent to prison...
J	00:25:13.440	00:25:15.760	he was really horrible...
J	00:25:15.760	00:25:19.750	he cheated us out of lots of money.
J	00:25:19.760	00:25:21.590	but hey, we were young and innocent.
J	00:25:21.600	00:25:23.350	things happen.
F	00:25:23.360	00:25:25.440	how young?
J	00:25:25.440	00:25:27.840	well, i was eight when i joined the band...
J	00:25:27.840	00:25:32.159	so i guess i was ten when we split up.
A	00:25:32.159	00:25:34.230	right.
A	00:25:34.240	00:25:37.990	so, could you sing something for us now?
J	00:25:38.000	00:25:40.720	sure. i'd love to.
J	00:25:40.720	00:25:43.585	i'd like to sing Amazing Grace.
J	00:25:47.239	00:25:54.871	Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound...

D	00:25:59.360	00:26:05.430	hi, hello, i'd like some information on your acupuncture classes, please.
D	00:26:05.440	00:26:09.919	yeah, it's Jane Wilson.
D	00:26:09.919	00:26:10.870	the address is...
D	00:26:10.880	00:26:14.659	number nine, manchester road, oxford...
D	00:26:16.344	00:26:17.117	okay, bye.
C	00:26:31.840	00:26:34.640	what do you make of that?
D	00:26:34.640	00:26:36.549	he's amazing.
D	00:26:36.559	00:26:38.960	i had no idea he played the piano.
C	00:26:38.960	00:26:41.990	he's quite something, isn't he?
D	00:26:42.000	00:26:45.029	maybe, but, like i said, he's not for me.
C	00:26:45.039	00:26:46.640	oh come off it, Jane!
C	00:26:46.640	00:26:48.670	you're crazy about him!
D	00:26:49.919	00:26:52.230	we're just having a bit of fun that's all.
D	00:26:53.520	00:26:56.370	we're just two ships passing in the night.
C	00:26:57.679	00:27:02.310	well, i hope you won't be sending me an sos!

F	00:27:02.320	00:27:04.159	that was hopeless.
F	00:27:04.159	00:27:05.120	ten singers...
H	00:27:05.120	00:27:07.440	and ten disasters.
A	00:27:07.440	00:27:10.630	what about Melissa?
F	00:27:10.640	00:27:12.620	her singing was even worse than yours!
H	00:27:12.691	00:27:14.230	pretty fit though!
H	00:27:14.240	00:27:15.200	in an obvious way...
H	00:27:15.200	00:27:19.269	that doesn't appeal to me.
F	00:27:19.279	00:27:21.750	i think we could all do with a drink.
A	00:27:21.760	00:27:24.950	good idea.

E	00:27:24.960	00:27:27.840	i played in jazz clubs back home.
E	00:27:27.840	00:27:30.808	for a time i even thought about going professional...
E	00:27:30.720	00:27:38.549	you know... work, money, career.
E	00:27:38.559	00:27:40.320	why don't you sing along?
D	00:27:40.320	00:27:40.960	me?
E	00:27:40.960	00:27:42.310	why not?
D	00:27:42.320	00:27:43.200	i can't!
C	00:27:43.200	00:27:49.430	you're always singing at home.
E	00:27:49.440	00:27:58.480	Mustang Sally, i guess you'd better slow that mustang down.
E	00:27:58.480	00:28:07.030	come on! don't be shy.
D	00:28:13.840	00:28:19.720	all you wanna do is ride around Sally, ride sally ride.
H	00:28:19.965	00:28:20.080	wow!
F	00:28:20.080	00:28:22.140	i think you've found your singer.
A	00:28:23.390	00:28:24.140	absolutely.
H	00:28:24.230	00:28:26.350	what if Bill doesn't want to do it?
A	00:28:26.720	00:28:27.100	Bill?
D	00:28:29.360	00:28:36.840	you're gonna be wiping those weeping eyes.
H	00:28:47.840	00:28:50.960	so you're telling us the contract's a disaster.
G	00:28:50.960	00:28:55.750	i'm afraid so.
H	00:28:55.760	00:28:59.120	what if we decided to ignore the contract?
G	00:28:59.120	00:29:00.080	well, you could ignore it...
G	00:29:00.080	00:29:03.990	but my advice is that you would be in big trouble.
H	00:29:04.000	00:29:05.840	that's just brilliant!
H	00:29:05.840	00:29:07.840	why did you sign it?
H	00:29:07.840	00:29:13.750	a contract drawn up by a wide boy like Eddie usher.
A	00:29:13.760	00:29:17.830	what happens if we do the gig. David?
G	00:29:17.840	00:29:19.440	Eddie will get all the money.
H	00:29:19.440	00:29:23.190	i'm not turning up at the galaxy just to line eddie usher's pockets.
H	00:29:23.200	00:29:25.440	you'd better do something about that contract.
H	00:29:25.440	00:29:27.520	oh we won't be playing any gigs anywhere.
A	00:29:27.520	00:29:29.919	okay. i'll think of something.
H	00:29:29.919	00:29:33.200	yeah right, and what about Jane?
H	00:29:33.200	00:29:34.870	is she gonna sing with us or not?
A	00:29:34.880	00:29:37.909	look, i'm working on it.
A	00:29:37.919	00:29:39.030	don't worry!

D	00:30:11.840	00:30:16.960	wow! somebody likes you.
C	00:30:16.960	00:30:18.630	i doubt it.
D	00:30:18.640	00:30:19.679	who are they from?
C	00:30:19.679	00:30:20.720	i don't know.
C	00:30:20.720	00:30:23.750	there's no card or anything.
D	00:30:23.760	00:30:25.600	oh, they're wonderful.
C	00:30:25.600	00:30:26.880	they must be from Bill.
C	00:30:26.880	00:30:28.720	he likes to send flowers.
C	00:30:28.720	00:30:41.909	i'll put them in some water.
E	00:30:41.919	00:30:44.460	yes!
E	00:30:48.159	00:30:49.080	Jane, hi!
D	00:30:49.080	00:30:53.039	hi! Bill. i don't know what i've done to deserve them...
D	00:30:53.039	00:30:55.669	but thanks for the flowers.
E	00:30:55.679	00:30:57.120	the flowers?
D	00:30:57.120	00:30:58.789	they're wonderful.
E	00:30:58.799	00:31:00.640	but not from me.
D	00:31:00.640	00:31:02.149	they're not?
E	00:31:02.159	00:31:04.559	no, but anyway.
E	00:31:04.559	00:31:05.830	it's good you called.
E	00:31:05.840	00:31:07.039	can we meet up later?
E	00:31:07.039	00:31:10.080	something's come up and i'd really like to talk to you about it.
D	00:31:10.080	00:31:11.279	such as?
E	00:31:11.279	00:31:14.230	well, i really don't want to talk about it on the phone.
E	00:31:14.240	00:31:16.069	i'd rather tell you face to face.
E	00:31:16.799	00:31:17.760	i'll pick you up seven.
E	00:31:17.760	00:31:19.090	would that be okay?
D	00:31:19.360	00:31:23.350	sure. i'll see you at seven. bye!
D	00:31:23.360	00:31:24.720	that's weird.
D	00:31:24.720	00:31:29.430	they're not from Bill.
C	00:31:29.440	00:31:34.950	it's Eddie.
C	00:31:34.960	00:31:36.159	hello Eddie.
C	00:31:36.159	00:31:38.070	we're glad you've called.
B	00:31:38.080	00:31:38.960	are you?
B	00:31:38.960	00:31:40.159	that's nice.
B	00:31:40.159	00:31:41.200	nah listen, girls.
B	00:31:41.200	00:31:44.559	i'm a reasonable man, but rules are there to be obeyed.
B	00:31:44.559	00:31:47.919	you're getting behind with your rent and that isn't good for anyone.
B	00:31:47.919	00:31:50.159	why don't you arrange a standing order with your bank...
B	00:31:50.159	00:31:51.750	to pay me to rent every month?
B	00:31:51.760	00:31:56.149	because if you do that, we'll avoid any unnecessary unpleasantness.
D	00:31:56.159	00:32:00.310	when you fix the wiring and repair the water heater, we'll pay the rent.
D	00:32:00.320	00:32:02.050	but not before!
C	00:32:15.440	00:32:16.640	that told him.
C	00:32:16.640	00:32:19.590	at least we know Eddie can't have sent the flowers!
D	00:32:19.600	00:32:21.200	you know what?
D	00:32:21.200	00:32:23.519	i think it must have been Matt.
C	00:32:23.519	00:32:26.630	oh perhaps you better call him.
D	00:32:26.640	00:32:28.450	could you do it?
D	00:32:28.840	00:32:29.150	please?
A	00:32:43.740	00:32:45.440	hi, Matt here.
C	00:32:52.799	00:32:54.240	is that you, Matt?
C	00:32:54.240	00:32:57.190	it's Ali.
A	00:32:57.200	00:33:01.430	sorry, Ali. there was, uh, something funny with the line.
C	00:33:01.440	00:33:03.679	i i know this is a bit of an odd question...
C	00:33:03.679	00:33:06.710	but did you send some flowers to Jane this morning?
A	00:33:06.720	00:33:08.480	will she do it?
C	00:33:08.480	00:33:09.750	what?
A	00:33:09.760	00:33:11.440	it was all on the note.
C	00:33:11.440	00:33:13.590	there was no note.
A	00:33:13.600	00:33:14.320	oh no.
A	00:33:14.320	00:33:16.080	it must have fallen off.
A	00:33:16.080	00:33:17.830	i want her to sing with us!
C	00:33:17.840	00:33:20.240	sing with you?
A	00:33:20.240	00:33:21.990	well with the band.
A	00:33:22.000	00:33:22.799	we need a singer...
A	00:33:22.799	00:33:25.990	and when we heard Jane the other night, we thought...
A	00:33:26.000	00:33:28.799	well, i thought she was brilliant.
C	00:33:28.799	00:33:29.990	did you?
C	00:33:30.000	00:33:31.440	so did i.
C	00:33:31.440	00:33:32.080	you know something?
C	00:33:32.080	00:33:34.230	that's a really nice idea.
C	00:33:34.240	00:33:36.630	i'll have a word with her about it.
A	00:33:36.640	00:33:37.279	thanks, Ali.
A	00:33:37.279	00:33:39.430	you're a star.
C	00:33:39.440	00:33:41.840	bye Matt.
C	00:33:41.840	00:33:54.610	how about trying something that could really change your life?

G	00:34:04.960	00:34:06.000	i can't believe this.
G	00:34:06.000	00:34:07.600	it's crazy.
G	00:34:07.600	00:34:09.669	you know he's my job if i get caught.
A	00:34:09.679	00:34:11.990	Eddie's the real criminal, not us.
G	00:34:12.000	00:34:14.149	I'll probably go to prison.
A	00:34:14.159	00:34:15.679	but if we don't find the contract...
A	00:34:15.679	00:34:18.399	i'll never be able to pay you back all your money.
A	00:34:18.399	00:34:20.039	so let's get started.
G	00:34:26.399	00:34:28.800	how are we going to find the contract in all this lot?
A	00:34:28.800	00:34:29.359	it's like looking for...
A	00:34:29.359	00:34:41.270	a needle in a haystack, i know.
A	00:34:41.280	00:34:44.079	have you got it already?
G	00:34:44.079	00:34:45.019	no... but...
A	00:34:49.119	00:34:51.310	it's Eddie.

E	00:35:08.320	00:35:09.990	so what i wanted to say to you was...
D	00:35:10.000	00:35:12.550	they've offered you the job in new york.
E	00:35:12.560	00:35:13.839	that's right.
E	00:35:13.839	00:35:15.119	they emailed me this morning...
E	00:35:15.119	00:35:25.750	and wanted to know how soon I...
D	00:35:16.990	00:35:17.250	stop!
B	00:35:25.760	00:35:28.630	what the hell are you doing in here?
G	00:35:28.640	00:35:31.280	legally, it's called breaking and entering.
B	00:35:31.280	00:35:32.400	who do you think you are?
B	00:35:32.400	00:35:33.430	a lawyer?
G	00:35:33.440	00:35:34.160	that's right.
G	00:35:34.160	00:35:36.240	and i'm representing Matt and Simon.
G	00:35:36.240	00:35:37.440	i wouldn't do that if i were you.
G	00:35:37.440	00:35:40.230	if you call the police, i'll have to show them this...
G	00:35:40.240	00:35:42.160	mr Usher.
G	00:35:42.160	00:35:45.270	or should i say... mr Pym?
G	00:35:45.280	00:35:47.359	or mr de Quincy?
G	00:35:47.359	00:35:51.990	or Senor Hector Fernandez?
G	00:35:52.000	00:35:55.920	now the contract for the ban isn't very favorable to my clients.
G	00:35:55.920	00:36:04.630	i wonder if i might suggest one or two changes.
A	00:36:04.640	00:36:06.160	David! are you okay?
G	00:36:06.400	00:36:07.589	couldn't be better.
G	00:36:07.599	00:36:10.630	listen Eddie's agreed to make changes to the contract.
A	00:36:10.640	00:36:12.079	has he cancelled the gig?
G	00:36:12.079	00:36:13.359	no, the gig's fine.
G	00:36:13.359	00:36:16.710	also, he's going to be doing some repairs to Jane's flat.
G	00:36:16.720	00:36:19.040	all you need now is a singer.
A	00:36:19.040	00:36:19.829	a what?
G	00:36:19.839	00:36:22.160	a singer!
A	00:36:22.160	00:36:24.790	yeah, i'm working on it!
G	00:36:24.800	00:36:25.119	good.
G	00:36:25.119	00:36:27.910	the only concession eddie wasn't prepared to make...
G	00:36:27.920	00:36:31.280	was that the lead singer could be you, sorry.
G	00:36:31.280	00:36:33.359	catch you later, bye.
A	00:36:33.680	00:36:35.190	bye.
D	00:36:35.200	00:36:41.370	Matt, would you mind telling us what's going on?
A	00:36:50.960	00:36:53.359	i've been dreaming of this, Jane.
A	00:36:53.359	00:36:59.510	i always knew you'd come back to me.
E	00:36:59.520	00:37:00.880	Jane, hi!
D	00:37:00.880	00:37:02.400	oh, hi.
E	00:37:02.400	00:37:04.390	how are things?
D	00:37:04.400	00:37:06.880	oh, fine.
E	00:37:06.880	00:37:11.200	listen. can we meet up later?
D	00:37:11.200	00:37:12.550	uh, i don't know.
D	00:37:12.560	00:37:14.640	i'm not quite sure what i'm doing...
E	00:37:14.640	00:37:17.280	the thing is. i really need to talk to you...
E	00:37:17.280	00:37:19.030	and we never really got a chance the other day...
E	00:37:19.040	00:37:22.630	what with Matt's unexpected arrival.
D	00:37:22.640	00:37:23.920	we could talk now.
E	00:37:24.079	00:37:24.480	i'm sorry.
E	00:37:24.480	00:37:25.200	i can't right now.
E	00:37:25.200	00:37:26.950	i've got to go to the office.
D	00:37:26.960	00:37:28.480	on a saturday?
E	00:37:28.480	00:37:31.440	there's loads of stuff i need to sort out, you know...
E	00:37:31.440	00:37:33.349	for the move back to new york.
E	00:37:33.359	00:37:36.790	they're really putting me under pressure to leave as soon as possible.
D	00:37:36.800	00:37:39.200	right.
E	00:37:39.200	00:37:42.000	anyway, do you think we can meet up later...
E	00:37:42.000	00:37:44.310	say about eight?
D	00:37:44.320	00:37:46.160	well, you can try.
E	00:37:46.160	00:37:48.390	don't worry, i will.
E	00:37:48.400	00:37:56.660	i'd like to take you out for dinner.

C	00:38:07.440	00:38:09.040	i've been thinking.
D	00:38:09.040	00:38:10.000	uh-oh.
C	00:38:10.000	00:38:11.349	no, really.
C	00:38:11.359	00:38:13.829	what are you going to do about the band?
D	00:38:13.839	00:38:16.240	don't you start.
D	00:38:16.240	00:38:19.510	i've already been sent this.
D	00:38:19.520	00:38:21.760	he's a bit desperate, isn't he?
C	00:38:21.760	00:38:23.030	well, wouldn't you be?
C	00:38:23.040	00:38:24.160	the gig's in ten hours.
C	00:38:24.160	00:38:26.069	you've got to let him know.
D	00:38:26.079	00:38:28.079	i will, i will.
C	00:38:28.079	00:38:29.839	it'd be awful to let him down.
C	00:38:29.839	00:38:31.359	and it isn't just him.
C	00:38:31.359	00:38:32.150	there's Simon.
C	00:38:32.160	00:38:32.870	there's Helen.
C	00:38:32.880	00:38:34.960	she's doing everything she can.
C	00:38:34.960	00:38:40.710	even David's helping out and for no money!
C	00:38:40.720	00:38:42.240	why don't you sing with them?
C	00:38:42.240	00:38:44.960	you know the songs, and you've got a fabulous voice.
C	00:38:44.960	00:38:46.720	what have you got to lose?
D	00:38:46.720	00:38:49.109	you know what the problem is.
D	00:38:49.119	00:38:52.800	i just don't want matt getting the wrong idea.
D	00:38:52.800	00:38:56.790	anyway, Bill wants to take me out for dinner tonight.
D	00:38:56.800	00:39:01.109	it's funny how people think bad news and food go together.
C	00:39:01.119	00:39:03.680	i really think you should give Matt a break.
C	00:39:03.680	00:39:05.750	doesn't he deserve it?
D	00:39:05.760	00:39:07.359	deserve it?
C	00:39:07.359	00:39:09.829	he's put such a lot of effort into this band.
C	00:39:09.839	00:39:12.800	and he's tried so hard to put your relationship behind him.
C	00:39:12.800	00:39:14.630	he isn't trying it on, i'm sure of it.
C	00:39:14.640	00:39:16.800	he doesn't want to get back together with you.
D	00:39:16.800	00:39:20.470	you seem to know an awful lot about Matt all of a sudden.
C	00:39:20.480	00:39:32.990	well, we've talked about it, that's all.

A	00:39:38.320	00:39:42.390	one, two, one, two.
C	00:39:42.400	00:39:43.839	it's not very original!
A	00:39:43.839	00:39:47.910	Ali!
A	00:39:47.920	00:39:51.910	it's great to see you, but you're a bit early for the gig.
C	00:39:51.920	00:39:56.470	i know... i was just wondering if there's anything i could do to help.
A	00:39:56.480	00:39:58.320	that's really nice of you.
C	00:39:58.320	00:40:02.230	i want it to go well.
A	00:40:02.240	00:40:12.960	is there any news about Jane?
D	00:40:15.839	00:40:16.770	hi.
E	00:40:16.770	00:40:17.120	hi.
A	00:40:34.640	00:40:37.200	she's not coming, is she?
C	00:40:37.200	00:40:40.069	she must have decided to go out to dinner with Bill.
H	00:40:40.079	00:40:53.589	okay, Matt. it's down to you.

A	00:40:53.599	00:41:01.119	everybody, gather round... everybody...
B	00:41:01.119	00:41:04.230	can anyone tell me what's going on?
A	00:41:04.240	00:41:06.480	we're just warming up.
B	00:41:06.480	00:41:08.069	where's your singer?
A	00:41:08.079	00:41:09.760	she couldn't make it.
B	00:41:09.760	00:41:11.829	couldn't make it?
B	00:41:11.839	00:41:14.160	i've invited important people from the business.
B	00:41:14.160	00:41:16.870	i've signed a contract that gives away nearly all my rights...
B	00:41:16.880	00:41:21.190	and now you're telling me you haven't even got a singer.
B	00:41:21.200	00:41:22.480	you're not singing, Matt.
B	00:41:22.480	00:41:23.599	no way.
B	00:41:23.599	00:41:25.349	contract clearly stipulates...
B	00:41:25.359	00:41:27.839	that you are not going to sing with the band.
B	00:41:27.839	00:41:30.790	am i right or am i right?
G	00:41:30.800	00:41:33.920	from a strictly contractual point of view, you're right.
A	00:41:33.920	00:41:39.100	Eddie, we're on in a few minutes!

E	00:41:46.839	00:41:49.200	Jane...
E	00:41:49.200	00:41:52.790	i really care about you.
E	00:41:52.800	00:41:55.090	you're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
E	00:41:56.800	00:41:59.280	and i don't want to lose you.
D	00:41:59.280	00:42:01.839	well, i'm not the one who's going to new york.
E	00:42:01.839	00:42:03.430	you can come with me.
D	00:42:03.440	00:42:05.040	what?
E	00:42:05.040	00:42:06.630	well, i don't mean...
E	00:42:06.640	00:42:08.160	i don't know what i mean.
E	00:42:08.160	00:42:13.829	but there must be a way we can make this work. please.
D	00:42:13.839	00:42:16.560	oh i'm so sorry!
D	00:42:16.560	00:42:18.480	i really ought to answer this.
E	00:42:18.480	00:42:19.080	okay.
C	00:42:22.160	00:42:23.599	Jane, where are you?
C	00:42:23.599	00:42:25.920	we need you desperately!
D	00:42:25.920	00:42:26.960	what's happened?
B	00:42:26.960	00:42:29.030	and now let me introduce to you...
B	00:42:29.040	00:42:36.480	the one and only broken heart featuring... Eddie... Usher!!!
D	00:42:39.280	00:42:42.550	Eddie?! you've got to be joking!
C	00:42:42.560	00:42:44.640	they didn't have a choice.
D	00:42:44.640	00:42:45.510	wait a moment.
D	00:42:45.520	00:42:47.190	i need to talk to Bill.
E	00:42:47.200	00:42:47.839	what's going on?
E	00:42:47.839	00:42:49.440	is it the gig?
D	00:42:49.440	00:42:52.800	yes. it's a disaster.
D	00:42:52.800	00:42:55.440	i've really got to go and sing.
E	00:42:55.440	00:43:00.230	okay! we can sort this out later.
D	00:43:00.240	00:43:11.920	Ali... i'm coming!
B	00:43:11.920	00:43:14.530	oh baby, please don't go.
B	00:43:20.000	00:43:20.400	what's up?
B	00:43:20.400	00:43:21.440	what's going on?
A	00:43:21.440	00:43:22.400	sorry, Eddie.
A	00:43:22.400	00:43:25.839	uh change your plan.
B	00:43:25.839	00:43:26.640	what she doing here?
B	00:43:26.640	00:43:28.240	the contract clearly stipulates...
G	00:43:28.240	00:43:30.319	that the band can choose its own singer.
G	00:43:30.319	00:43:33.109	provided it's not Matt.
G	00:43:33.119	00:43:33.839	come on, Eddie.
G	00:43:33.839	00:43:36.710	you know it makes sense.
B	00:43:36.720	00:43:38.720	break a leg!!
B	00:43:38.720	00:43:43.750	you better be good.
B	00:43:43.760	00:43:54.040	those boys have got a damn good deal out of me.
D	00:43:56.839	00:44:04.880	long a float on shipless oceans.
D	00:44:04.880	00:44:13.880	i did all my best to smile till your singing eyes and fingers.
D	00:44:14.120	00:44:23.010	here i am, here i am. waiting to hold you.
