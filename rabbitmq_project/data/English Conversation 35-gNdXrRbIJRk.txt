F	00:11:39.279	00:11:42.470	well, the hotel isn't very nice, dear.
A	00:11:42.480	00:11:44.640	i'm sorry to hear that.
A	00:11:44.640	00:11:46.230	are you okay?
A	00:11:46.240	00:11:48.720	you sound tired.
F	00:11:48.720	00:11:51.040	my room is on the fifth floor.
F	00:11:51.040	00:11:53.760	i had to walk up with my luggage.
A	00:11:53.760	00:11:55.590	there's no bellman?
A	00:11:55.600	00:11:57.760	no elevator?

A	00:12:02.720	00:12:05.040	and i requested that for you.
F	00:12:05.040	00:12:09.990	well, they gave me a smoking room with a twin-size bed.
F	00:12:10.000	00:12:12.079	it's all they have.

F	00:12:34.320	00:12:37.110	and there are all these students everywhere.
F	00:12:37.120	00:12:40.949	i thought you said that movie stars stay at this hotel.
A	00:12:40.959	00:12:48.230	mrs beatty, your reservation is for the chandler inn.
A	00:12:48.240	00:12:50.720	you're in the wrong hotel.

A	00:13:00.959	00:13:04.310	how will you get your bags to the front desk?
F	00:13:04.320	00:13:06.470	i'm sure i can find a student to help.
F	00:13:06.480	00:13:08.150	i'll say i'm a movie star.
F	00:13:08.160	00:13:09.519	i'll be fine.

A	00:13:22.800	00:13:26.629	we're running out of time.
A	00:13:26.639	00:13:29.120	oh, there she is.
G	00:13:29.120	00:13:30.710	i'm sorry i'm late.
G	00:13:30.720	00:13:32.959	i couldn't find a parking space.
G	00:13:32.959	00:13:34.470	have you been here long?
E	00:13:34.480	00:13:36.079	since yesterday.
E	00:13:36.079	00:13:37.750	but it's no problem.
E	00:13:37.760	00:13:39.760	the waiter brought us food.
E	00:13:39.760	00:13:44.230	and we slept on the floor.
G	00:13:44.240	00:13:46.160	have you chosen a movie yet?
A	00:13:46.160	00:13:47.519	we've been trying.
A	00:13:47.519	00:13:51.670	unfortunately, these guys have seen almost everything.
C	00:13:51.680	00:13:54.480	we like the movies.
F	00:13:54.480	00:13:59.509	what about the action film, the last train to hong kong?
E	00:13:59.519	00:14:01.279	"where is this train going?"
C	00:14:01.279	00:14:03.760	"believe me, you'd rather not know."
E	00:14:03.760	00:14:07.269	"we're going to hong kong, aren't we?"
C	00:14:07.279	00:14:09.829	"rather stay here and fight the one hunderd men?"
E	00:14:09.839	00:14:13.293	"no, and i've always wanted to see hong kong."
C	00:14:13.550	00:14:14.136	"look out!"
A	00:14:16.800	00:14:20.949	they've been doing this for a half hour.
G	00:14:20.959	00:14:24.389	that looks a little too violent for me.
G	00:14:24.399	00:14:26.720	what about on the bridge?
G	00:14:26.720	00:14:28.800	i hear it's great.
E	00:14:28.800	00:14:30.880	"you're late, frederick."
C	00:14:30.880	00:14:32.870	"i'm sorry."
E	00:14:32.880	00:14:36.550	"and i've waited for you for so long."
C	00:14:36.560	00:14:40.389	"i got stuck in traffic."
E	00:14:40.399	00:14:43.360	"for two years?"
A	00:14:43.360	00:14:46.079	very romantic.
G	00:14:46.079	00:14:50.310	how about the horror movie the hand?
C	00:14:50.320	00:14:52.492	"i've just returned from the train station. 
C	00:14:52.509	00:14:53.823	have you seen anything lately?"
E	00:14:53.760	00:14:56.320	"no, we should go inside."
C	00:14:56.320	00:14:59.670	"good idea. i don't want to see that terrible head."
E	00:14:59.680	00:15:02.949	"do you really think there's a hand out there that..."
G	00:15:02.959	00:15:05.120	stop doing that right now.
G	00:15:05.120	00:15:07.211	and the movie tickets are my treat.
E	00:15:07.767	00:15:08.674	deal!
G	00:15:12.880	00:15:14.042	i'm not buying you popcorn.

C	00:17:07.679	00:17:10.400	hello.
A	00:17:10.400	00:17:13.679	paul, what happened to you?
C	00:17:13.679	00:17:15.510	i had an accident with the van.
G	00:17:15.520	00:17:16.480	oh, no!
G	00:17:16.480	00:17:17.520	are you okay?
C	00:17:17.520	00:17:18.710	i'm fine.
C	00:17:18.720	00:17:20.559	i was wearing my seat belt.
C	00:17:20.559	00:17:21.919	no one was hurt.
C	00:17:21.919	00:17:23.760	but i think we're going to need a new van.
E	00:17:23.760	00:17:25.350	what happened?
C	00:17:25.360	00:17:27.520	i was driving on sixth street.
C	00:17:27.520	00:17:29.363	and there were a lot of fish on the road.
A	00:17:30.720	00:17:32.402	a lot of what?
C	00:17:33.200	00:17:33.857	fish.
A	00:17:35.200	00:17:38.390	why were there fish in the road?
C	00:17:38.400	00:17:40.080	i don't know.
C	00:17:40.080	00:17:42.710	anyway, i tried to turn.
C	00:17:42.720	00:17:44.480	but i had a problem with the steering wheel.
E	00:17:44.480	00:17:46.230	the steering wheel broke?
C	00:17:46.240	00:17:48.080	no.
C	00:17:48.080	00:17:50.710	it came off.
C	00:17:50.720	00:17:54.070	so i drove over the fish.
C	00:17:54.080	00:17:56.320	the fish made the road slippery.
C	00:17:56.320	00:17:59.840	so i tried to stop, i hit a parked car.
E	00:17:59.840	00:18:01.440	oh, no!
C	00:18:01.440	00:18:03.430	i'm not finished.
C	00:18:03.440	00:18:06.630	the car behind me was tailgating, so he hit me.
C	00:18:06.640	00:18:09.600	a car on the opposite side of the road hit a stop sign.
C	00:18:09.600	00:18:12.175	the stop sign fell and smashed my hood.
G	00:18:12.203	00:18:13.162	oh, no.
C	00:18:13.600	00:18:21.480	then, worst of all, when i got out to look at the damage, a piano fell on the van.
A	00:18:23.679	00:18:26.480	what? where did it come from?
C	00:18:26.480	00:18:27.909	i don't know.
C	00:18:27.919	00:18:30.320	but the van does not look good.
C	00:18:30.320	00:18:31.760	the bumpers are damaged..
C	00:18:31.760	00:18:32.799	so is the hood.
C	00:18:32.799	00:18:34.335	the doors won't open.
C	00:18:34.349	00:18:35.871	the windows won't close.
C	00:18:35.890	00:18:37.505	the engine's not working.
C	00:18:37.732	00:18:39.762	the headlights are smashed.
C	00:18:39.600	00:18:42.400	the horn won't honk.
C	00:18:42.400	00:18:45.909	and it smells like fish.
E	00:18:45.919	00:18:49.830	are there any parts that are ok?
C	00:18:49.840	00:18:52.390	the steering wheel still looks good.
E	00:18:52.400	00:18:53.280	great!
E	00:18:53.280	00:19:00.470	all we need is a van to go with it.
