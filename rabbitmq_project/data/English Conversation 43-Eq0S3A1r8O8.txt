J	00:20:07.440	00:20:10.149	i had to go to the police station about kylie and jason.
G	00:20:10.159	00:20:11.280	not now, sean.
G	00:20:11.280	00:20:12.909	we need to go in five minutes.
J	00:20:15.919	00:20:17.840	what's the matter with him today?
E	00:20:17.840	00:20:18.720	it's ellie.
J	00:20:18.720	00:20:19.669	ellie.
E	00:20:19.679	00:20:20.960	she's gone.
J	00:20:20.960	00:20:21.919	gone.
E	00:20:21.919	00:20:23.350	to the states.
J	00:20:23.360	00:20:24.880	to the states.
E	00:20:24.880	00:20:26.211	she left yesterday.
E	00:20:29.360	00:20:32.470	you see, yesterday was ellie's birthday.
E	00:20:32.480	00:20:36.710	tim, gary, julia and i went back to my place for a birthday drink for ellie.
E	00:20:36.720	00:20:40.820	ellie wasn't there, but there was a message from her on the answerphone.
E	00:20:41.120	00:20:47.590	she said that she had a new job in san francisco and well... goodbye.
J	00:20:47.600	00:20:48.559	what did tim do?
E	00:20:48.559	00:20:50.240	he just walked out of the flat.
E	00:20:50.240	00:20:51.909	he didn't say a word.
E	00:20:51.919	00:20:54.654	it was all very sad and, well, embarrassing.
E	00:20:54.654	00:20:56.549	we didn't know what to do.
N	00:20:56.559	00:20:58.559	no wonder he's in a bad mood.
E	00:20:58.559	00:21:02.080	but it's not all bad news, because julia's my new flatmate now.
G	00:21:02.080	00:21:03.430	come on, sean.

G	00:22:35.840	00:22:37.741	ok, i think we can take a look at that now.
O	00:22:39.440	00:22:42.630	last year richard bennett gave up his job in a london bank...
O	00:22:42.640	00:22:45.510	...and decided to walk to the south pole.
O	00:22:45.520	00:22:47.750	why did you give up your job, richard?
P	00:22:47.760	00:22:52.549	well, i didn't like my job and i had a lot of problems at home.
P	00:22:52.559	00:22:55.750	i just wanted to get away from it all.
P	00:22:55.760	00:22:58.480	i wanted to find myself, if you like.
O	00:22:58.480	00:23:00.230	so you left england in august.
O	00:23:00.240	00:23:01.760	what did you do first?
P	00:23:01.760	00:23:04.230	i flew to buenos aires in argentina.
P	00:23:04.240	00:23:06.571	from there i traveled to the antarctic by boat.
O	00:23:07.919	00:23:10.076	when did you actually start your journey to the pole?
P	00:23:11.280	00:23:15.029	well, i had to wait for a few weeks, because the weather was very bad...
P	00:23:15.039	00:23:17.679	...so i didn't set off until the end of september.
O	00:23:17.679	00:23:18.950	did anyone go with you?
P	00:23:18.960	00:23:20.960	no, i was on my own.
O	00:23:20.960	00:23:23.750	and did you reach the south pole?
P	00:23:23.760	00:23:25.919	no, i didn't.
P	00:23:25.919	00:23:30.480	after about three hundred kilometers i fell into a huge crevasse..
P	00:23:30.480	00:23:35.200	...you know- a big hole- about ten meters deep.
O	00:23:35.200	00:23:36.630	were you hurt?
P	00:23:36.640	00:23:38.960	yes, i broke my arm.
P	00:23:38.960	00:23:40.789	i couldn't climb out.
O	00:23:40.799	00:23:42.159	what did you do.
P	00:23:42.159	00:23:45.590	well, fortunately, my sledge fell into the hole with me...
P	00:23:45.760	00:23:49.110	i had food, and i had my radio, too.
P	00:23:49.120	00:23:51.039	and i called for help.
O	00:23:51.039	00:23:53.750	how long were you there before they found you?
P	00:23:53.760	00:23:54.880	five days.
P	00:23:54.880	00:23:57.510	there was a bad storm, you see.
P	00:23:57.520	00:24:03.029	i thought it was the end, but then suddenly i heard voices and dogs.
P	00:24:03.039	00:24:07.750	i shouted and shouted and faces appeared above me.
O	00:24:07.760	00:24:11.350	what did you think about, while you were in the crevasse?
P	00:24:11.360	00:24:15.590	i thought about my life back in england.
P	00:24:15.600	00:24:20.320	and the funny thing was that all my problems at home and at work...
P	00:24:20.320	00:24:22.470	...weren't important anymore.
P	00:24:22.480	00:24:26.870	i just wanted to be with my family and friends again.
P	00:24:26.880	00:24:29.520	life's very short, you know.
P	00:24:29.520	00:24:32.549	you have to enjoy it while you can.
O	00:24:32.559	00:24:34.880	thank you very much.

P	00:24:56.960	00:24:59.029	...weren't important anymore.
