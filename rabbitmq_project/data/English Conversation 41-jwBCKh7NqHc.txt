D	00:00:58.239	00:01:01.199	why are you both carrying shopping?
A	00:01:01.199	00:01:02.950	jane got the wrong day.

B	00:01:11.040	00:01:11.680	hang on a minute.
B	00:01:11.680	00:01:13.119	that's not right.

D	00:04:05.920	00:04:06.289	yes.
A	00:04:08.319	00:04:12.179	we could do something, go somewhere.
A	00:04:13.519	00:04:15.140	we could go for a picnic.
A	00:04:15.840	00:04:17.400	what do you think?
A	00:04:18.400	00:04:19.220	matt?

A	00:04:23.040	00:04:24.310	we're going to have a picnic.
C	00:04:26.320	00:04:27.260	that's not a bad idea.
A	00:04:28.560	00:04:30.120	i'll make some sandwiches.

A	00:04:47.520	00:04:48.140	come on.
A	00:05:29.120	00:05:31.020	we can go through this gate...
A	00:05:31.120	00:05:34.030	...then along the path between the wood and the farm.
A	00:05:34.240	00:05:36.000	that's the quickest way.
C	00:05:36.800	00:05:39.120	it's quicker on the road by car.
A	00:05:40.320	00:05:42.110	don't be so pathetic.
A	00:05:43.520	00:05:44.100	come on.
A	00:05:44.800	00:05:46.129	it'll only take ten minutes.

B	00:05:56.639	00:05:58.220	this is perfect.
B	00:05:59.520	00:06:02.150	it's so much nicer than the city.
B	00:06:03.360	00:06:04.880	it's beautiful.
E	00:06:04.880	00:06:05.520	yes.
E	00:06:05.520	00:06:07.029	it really is.
A	00:06:08.639	00:06:10.060	it's this way.
B	00:06:10.960	00:06:12.170	that's jane!
D	00:06:12.880	00:06:14.139	come on, david.
B	00:06:14.639	00:06:17.520	it's all three of them! quick!
E	00:06:17.520	00:06:18.260	what's the problem?
B	00:06:18.560	00:06:19.680	they don't know about this.
E	00:06:19.680	00:06:20.069	what?
B	00:06:20.479	00:06:22.120	they think i went out for lunch.
B	00:06:22.720	00:06:23.279	let's go back.
B	00:06:24.479	00:06:25.240	please, simon.
E	00:06:25.440	00:06:26.250	ok.
C	00:06:28.560	00:06:30.479	how long did she say it was?
D	00:06:30.479	00:06:32.150	TEN minutes.
C	00:06:32.560	00:06:35.090	it's the longest ten minutes in history.
A	00:06:37.600	00:06:38.280	it's just through here.
B	00:06:48.080	00:06:50.280	simon, we're going the wrong way!
E	00:06:50.080	00:06:52.050	oh, no!
D	00:06:52.960	00:06:54.280	this was a great idea.
A	00:06:55.280	00:06:56.019	thanks.
C	00:06:55.919	00:06:57.290	it's a shame helen isn't here.
D	00:07:00.400	00:07:01.180	look at that.
A	00:07:01.680	00:07:02.200	what?
A	00:07:27.759	00:07:30.060	and this is really strange.
C	00:07:30.160	00:07:32.089	it just appeared from nowhere.
B	00:07:33.599	00:07:34.280	really?
D	00:07:35.680	00:07:37.010	that's funny.
A	00:07:37.120	00:07:38.080	what?
D	00:07:38.880	00:07:40.249	look at that bag.
D	00:07:43.759	00:07:46.069	it looks just like helen's.
B	00:07:50.879	00:07:55.130	in one of his plays, shakespeare said something about not telling the truth.
B	00:07:55.840	00:07:58.209	i wish i could remember what it was.
B	00:07:59.919	00:08:02.210	mornings aren't my favorite time of day.
B	00:08:02.720	00:08:06.000	but some mornings are definitely worse than others.
C	00:08:06.000	00:08:07.089	where's helen?
D	00:08:07.199	00:08:08.060	dunno.
A	00:08:08.560	00:08:10.350	perhaps we should go and call her.
D	00:08:11.360	00:08:12.170	don't bother.
C	00:08:17.680	00:08:18.220	are you all right?

B	00:08:24.260	00:08:26.141	...my whole body aches.

C	00:12:29.040	00:12:30.220	what do you mean, 'it's much better'?
A	00:12:30.720	00:12:33.010	it contains only natural ingredients.
C	00:12:33.120	00:12:34.280	bet it tastes disgusting.
A	00:12:35.600	00:12:37.269	at least it's not full of chemicals.
C	00:12:38.079	00:12:39.600	aspirin's very effective.
C	00:12:39.600	00:12:41.010	it's been around for years.
A	00:12:41.920	00:12:43.100	so has arsenic.

B	00:13:16.000	00:13:17.260	but i'm not really hungry.
D	00:13:18.160	00:13:20.250	but you haven't eaten since last night.
B	00:13:21.360	00:13:22.189	sorry.
D	00:13:24.399	00:13:26.200	i don't think you should go to work tomorrow.
B	00:13:27.200	00:13:28.169	i don't know.
B	00:13:30.079	00:13:31.260	perhaps you're right.
D	00:13:32.160	00:13:34.130	you can stay here and watch the tennis.
B	00:13:35.040	00:13:36.140	tennis?
D	00:13:36.240	00:13:36.720	yeah.

B	00:13:39.760	00:13:41.019	who's that?
D	00:13:47.519	00:13:49.019	it's simon.
B	00:13:49.279	00:13:50.229	oh, no.
B	00:13:50.639	00:13:52.160	i look awful.
B	00:13:52.160	00:13:54.089	don't let him come up yet.
B	00:13:55.199	00:13:56.029	matt!
D	00:13:56.399	00:13:57.210	oh, right.
A	00:14:00.320	00:14:01.230	here's the patient.
E	00:14:05.040	00:14:06.279	how are you feeling?
B	00:14:07.279	00:14:08.290	not too bad.
B	00:14:08.800	00:14:11.119	you know, up and down.
E	00:14:11.519	00:14:13.170	i didn't know you weren't well.
E	00:14:14.480	00:14:17.189	i've got some tickets to see a salsa band tonight.
E	00:14:18.399	00:14:20.040	oh well, never mind.
B	00:14:20.240	00:14:22.030	i can still go.
A	00:14:22.880	00:14:24.080	no, you can't.
A	00:14:24.160	00:14:25.160	don't be silly.
E	00:14:26.240	00:14:27.180	jane's right.
E	00:14:27.680	00:14:29.290	you shouldn't go out when you've got flu.
E	00:14:29.600	00:14:31.120	you have to stay in bed.
B	00:14:31.920	00:14:33.199	but what about the tickets?
E	00:14:33.199	00:14:35.069	it doesn't matter about them.
C	00:14:35.279	00:14:36.939	it's a pity to waste them.
C	00:14:36.639	00:14:38.140	why don't you go with someone else?
B	00:14:38.140	00:14:39.189	what?
C	00:14:39.199	00:14:43.030	well, jane could have your ticket, and she could go with simon.
E	00:14:43.440	00:14:44.980	that's not a bad idea.
D	00:14:44.880	00:14:46.259	yeah, go on, jane.
B	00:14:47.519	00:14:50.210	look, i'm feeling much better.
E	00:14:50.110	00:14:50.860	HEY.
E	00:14:51.120	00:14:52.139	stay there.
E	00:14:52.639	00:14:54.050	you must keep warm.
A	00:14:56.160	00:14:57.160	ok.
A	00:14:57.360	00:14:58.290	i'll go and get ready.
E	00:15:01.600	00:15:03.020	we can go another time.
B	00:15:05.920	00:15:09.080	so i didn't get to see the salsa band with simon.
B	00:15:09.360	00:15:12.230	game, set and match to jane!
B	00:15:15.519	00:15:18.039	we all like our food in this house...
B	00:15:18.079	00:15:21.240	...but i think david likes it a bit more than the rest of us.
C	00:15:21.441	00:15:23.139	if nobody else wants this, i'll have it.
B	00:15:23.839	00:15:36.130	david, honestly! where do you put it?
D	00:15:30.240	00:15:32.050	you're such a pig.
A	00:15:33.120	00:15:34.150	if you're not careful.
A	00:15:34.160	00:15:35.260	you'll put on weight.
D	00:15:36.320	00:15:38.079	he's already flabby.
C	00:15:38.079	00:15:39.010	no, i'm not.
B	00:15:39.920	00:15:42.190	apparently, simon used to be quite fat.
C	00:15:43.600	00:15:45.039	i'm not flabby.
B	00:15:45.839	00:15:47.430	he keeps very fit now.
B	00:15:47.440	00:15:49.509	he goes to the gym four times a week.
C	00:15:49.519	00:15:51.509	gyms are so boring.
C	00:15:51.519	00:15:52.639	i play tennis.
C	00:15:52.639	00:15:54.600	at least that's competitive.
B	00:15:55.600	00:15:57.140	you used to play tennis.
C	00:15:57.440	00:15:59.509	and i had the time now.
C	00:15:59.519	00:16:02.710	anyway, julia thinks i look good.
D	00:16:04.720	00:16:09.040	yes, but will julia still think that when you're like a balloon?
C	00:16:17.320	00:16:23.040	a hundred and fifty pounds a month and five-hundred pounds to join?
C	00:16:24.240	00:16:27.069	actually, it's not really what i'm looking for.
C	00:16:27.279	00:16:27.720	thank you.
C	00:16:27.920	00:16:29.029	bye.
C	00:16:31.192	00:16:33.385	unbelievable.
C	00:16:46.240	00:16:46.800	oh, hello.
C	00:16:46.800	00:16:48.509	i'm interested in joining your health club.
C	00:16:49.519	00:16:51.389	could you tell me how much it is, please?
F	00:16:52.399	00:16:53.350	you're what?
C	00:16:53.360	00:16:55.910	i'm going to have a work-out this evening.
F	00:16:55.920	00:16:57.040	where?
C	00:16:57.040	00:16:58.639	at the new fitness club.
F	00:16:58.639	00:16:59.920	isn't that expensive?
C	00:16:59.920	00:17:00.720	it is...
C	00:17:00.720	00:17:03.680	but they offer a five-day free trial period.
F	00:17:03.680	00:17:04.309	free?
C	00:17:04.319	00:17:05.439	yeah.
F	00:17:05.439	00:17:07.590	oh david, you're terrible.
C	00:17:07.600	00:17:09.100	what's terrible about that?
C	00:17:10.400	00:17:13.909	anyway, i'm starting this evening, so i'll meet you as soon as i get out.
F	00:17:13.919	00:17:15.189	what time will that be?
C	00:17:15.199	00:17:16.160	i don't know yet.
C	00:17:16.160	00:17:18.030	might do a long session.
C	00:17:18.240	00:17:20.309	but i'll give you a call when i finish.
F	00:17:20.319	00:17:21.750	and then we're going for a drink.
C	00:17:21.760	00:17:23.000	absolutely.

G	00:17:26.000	00:17:28.710	last saturday we watched a horror film.
G	00:17:28.720	00:17:31.430	some of us found it really frightening.
A	00:17:31.440	00:17:33.590	she's going to go down the stairs.
A	00:17:33.600	00:17:35.039	oh, no!
A	00:17:35.039	00:17:36.000	don't do it!
F	00:17:36.000	00:17:37.350	why is she doing that?
C	00:17:37.360	00:17:38.559	because it's a horror film.
C	00:17:38.559	00:17:41.470	people always see stupid things in horror films.
B	00:17:41.480	00:17:43.080	i can't watch this.
B	00:17:46.480	00:17:47.640	what happened?
C	00:17:48.640	00:17:49.360	it killed her?
B	00:17:49.360	00:17:50.070	really?
E	00:17:50.080	00:17:50.559	NO.
E	00:17:50.559	00:17:52.020	the mother shot it.
C	00:17:52.080	00:17:54.799	what a load of rubbish!
F	00:17:54.799	00:17:56.070	it's not a load of rubbish.
F	00:17:56.080	00:17:57.029	it's good fun.
E	00:17:57.029	00:17:58.160	and it was very well made.
F	00:17:58.160	00:18:00.139	that's just what i was gonna say, thank you.
B	00:18:02.799	00:18:04.480	who wants coffee?
A	00:18:04.480	00:18:06.640	oh yes, PLEASE.
B	00:18:06.640	00:18:08.080	simon?
E	00:18:08.480	00:18:09.909	i'll get it.
C	00:18:09.919	00:18:12.200	i wouldn't go in the kitchen if i were you.
D	00:18:13.200	00:18:14.000	no, no, simon.
D	00:18:14.000	00:18:14.320	don't.
D	00:18:15.120	00:18:16.090	the ghost.
E	00:18:16.400	00:18:17.199	oh yeah.
E	00:18:17.919	00:18:18.950	the ghost.
C	00:18:21.760	00:18:22.360	actually...
E	00:18:23.360	00:18:24.160	what?
C	00:18:24.160	00:18:25.270	OH... nothing.
F	00:18:25.280	00:18:26.640	what, david?
C	00:18:26.640	00:18:30.080	well, there might be a ghost in this house.
B	00:18:30.080	00:18:30.720	where?
C	00:18:30.720	00:18:32.000	in the kitchen.
A	00:18:32.400	00:18:33.600	what kind of ghost?
C	00:18:33.600	00:18:35.350	the ghost of a dog.
F	00:18:35.360	00:18:36.789	don't be silly.
C	00:18:36.799	00:18:37.250	it's true.
B	00:18:40.160	00:18:42.010	i don't know anything about this.
C	00:18:42.080	00:18:44.229	well, before this house was built...
A	00:18:45.039	00:18:46.720	when was this house built?
B	00:18:46.720	00:18:48.190	about hundred and twenty years ago.
B	00:18:49.200	00:18:49.760	go on.
C	00:18:49.760	00:18:54.470	before this house was built, there used to be an old cottage here.
C	00:18:54.480	00:18:57.909	an old man lived in it and he had a large black dog.
C	00:18:57.919	00:19:01.039	and everywhere he went the dog went with him.
D	00:19:01.039	00:19:02.140	it never left him.
B	00:19:02.640	00:19:04.160	how do you know all this?
D	00:19:05.360	00:19:06.960	one of the neighbors told us.
C	00:19:06.960	00:19:11.020	anyway, the man was killed in an accident.
C	00:19:11.360	00:19:13.269	a new family moved into the cottage....
C	00:19:13.679	00:19:16.250	...and the dog was taken away by the old man's sister.
C	00:19:16.960	00:19:18.280	but that very first evening...
A	00:19:18.880	00:19:19.260	yes?
C	00:19:19.760	00:19:24.180	...the dog went back to the house and started howling.
B	00:19:24.880	00:19:26.000	what happened then?
C	00:19:26.000	00:19:27.100	the owners chased it away.
C	00:19:27.600	00:19:29.130	but it kept coming back.
C	00:19:29.440	00:19:31.060	every night they chased it away.
C	00:19:30.960	00:19:33.240	every night it came back... and howled.
E	00:19:34.240	00:19:35.160	and then?
C	00:19:35.760	00:19:40.230	well, not long after that, the cottage was destroyed by a fire.
D	00:19:40.640	00:19:42.229	and this house was built ten years later.
F	00:19:43.039	00:19:44.710	so where's the ghost?
C	00:19:44.720	00:19:46.710	well, when they were building this house...
C	00:19:46.720	00:19:50.240	...they found a skeleton of a large dog in the cellar.
D	00:19:52.240	00:19:57.130	and the neighbor says that sometimes late at night a dog is heard....
D	00:19:57.440	00:19:58.219	...howling
E	00:19:59.919	00:20:02.230	there's always a logical explanation for that kind of thing.
D	00:20:03.840	00:20:05.418	what would you do if you saw a ghost?
E	00:20:05.760	00:20:07.050	they don't exist.
F	00:20:07.360	00:20:09.020	if i saw a ghost i'd run away.
B	00:20:09.520	00:20:10.678	if i saw a ghost...
D	00:20:10.678	00:20:11.702	the ghost would run away!
C	00:20:14.960	00:20:16.040	ok,simon.
C	00:20:16.472	00:20:17.325	go make the coffee.
C	00:20:17.825	00:20:19.031	don't say i didn't warn you!
A	00:20:32.640	00:20:34.840	did you two really hear that story?
D	00:20:47.919	00:20:49.315	the others fancy some toast.
D	00:20:49.334	00:20:50.003	do you want some?
E	00:20:50.062	00:20:51.180	no, thanks.
D	00:20:52.764	00:20:53.711	that was a great story.
D	00:20:54.407	00:20:55.777	who said it was a story?
E	00:20:57.734	00:20:58.829	you know, the funny thing is...
D	00:21:00.634	00:21:01.040	what?
E	00:21:01.793	00:21:05.854	well, although i don't really believe in that sort of thing...
D	00:21:06.776	00:21:07.324	yes?
E	00:21:08.361	00:21:14.337	i have sometimes heard a dog howling late at night.
E	00:21:16.720	00:21:19.130	and i always thought it was coming from this house.
A	00:21:28.268	00:21:28.751	hi!...
A	00:21:30.192	00:21:31.691	biscuits.
A	00:21:34.040	00:21:34.833	matt.
D	00:21:35.502	00:21:35.964	yes?
A	00:21:37.089	00:21:37.864	are you all right?
D	00:21:38.473	00:21:40.653	yes, yes,i'm fine.
A	00:21:43.492	00:21:43.923	matt.
D	00:21:44.413	00:21:44.769	what?
A	00:21:45.328	00:21:48.970	if i were you, i wouldn't turn the light off in your bedroom tonight.
D	00:21:49.358	00:21:50.238	very funny!

G	00:22:08.343	00:22:10.746	the next morning, matt looked very tired...
G	00:22:11.475	00:22:12.454	for some reason.
G	00:22:16.778	00:22:18.418	it was a typical saturday night...
G	00:22:18.894	00:22:22.122	but matt was acting rather strangely.
A	00:22:24.455	00:22:24.993	thanks.
F	00:22:25.076	00:22:26.045	thank you.
C	00:22:31.668	00:22:32.720	oh,thanks.
A	00:22:35.644	00:22:36.782	are you all right, matt?
D	00:22:37.661	00:22:38.149	yes.
C	00:22:40.097	00:22:41.705	are you expecting someone?
D	00:22:43.210	00:22:43.786	no.
