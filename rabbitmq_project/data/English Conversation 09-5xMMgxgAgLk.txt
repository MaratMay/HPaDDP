A	00:04:46.950	00:04:49.690	yes, I've been busy cleaning all day.
A	00:04:49.690	00:04:52.880	trying to get all of my housework finished.
G	00:04:52.880	00:04:56.940	I'm so glad to have a new neighbor who's so friendly.
A	00:04:56.940	00:05:00.210	yes. I am so happy we moved here.

A	00:05:04.080	00:05:07.290	I talked to sue today on the telephone.
A	00:05:07.290	00:05:11.070	and she asked me to join you and go to the market together.

A	00:05:21.830	00:05:26.000	no. actually, I'll meet you at one o'clock there.

G	00:05:30.650	00:05:35.360	ok. it's very easy to get to the supermarket I can tell you.
A	00:05:35.370	00:05:36.810	ok. just a moment.
G	00:05:36.810	00:05:42.650	first, you go straight on Main Street for about one mile.
A	00:05:42.650	00:05:43.700	uh-huh.
G	00:05:43.710	00:05:51.110	at the second traffic light, turn left onto Grayson Avenue.
G	00:05:51.110	00:05:56.810	after you turn left, go straight about four blocks.
A	00:05:56.810	00:05:58.510	four blocks.
G	00:05:58.520	00:06:02.760	the supermarket will be on your right-hand side.
G	00:06:02.760	00:06:04.440	it's very large.
G	00:06:04.440	00:06:07.610	so you'll see it easily.
A	00:06:07.610	00:06:12.300	ok. let me repeat this to make sure I have the directions correctly.
G	00:06:12.300	00:06:13.160	alright.
A	00:06:13.160	00:06:17.150	go straight on Main Street for one mile.
A	00:06:17.150	00:06:22.790	turn left onto Grayson Avenue after the second traffic light.
A	00:06:22.790	00:06:27.650	go four blocks and the supermarket is on the right-hand side.
G	00:06:27.650	00:06:29.580	that's exactly right.
G	00:06:29.580	00:06:31.140	so I'll see you there.
A	00:06:31.140	00:06:33.630	ok, I'll see you there Kathy.

A	00:06:40.680	00:06:43.060	that was a funny story, Mary.
F	00:06:43.060	00:06:44.338	Yes, sure was.
A	00:06:44.338	00:06:46.629	just put those over there beside the sink.
F	00:06:46.629	00:06:47.740	by the sink?
A	00:06:47.740	00:06:49.058	yes, over there.
F	00:06:49.058	00:06:57.240	OK.
G	00:06:57.240	00:06:59.819	Mary what should I do with the salt and pepper?
A	00:06:59.819	00:07:02.160	you can put that beside the stove.
F	00:07:02.170	00:07:04.590	and how about these vegetables?
A	00:07:04.590	00:07:12.749	those can go in the refrigerator.
G	00:07:12.749	00:07:15.930	do you want this fruit in the refrigerator also?
A	00:07:15.930	00:07:24.330	no. that can go above the microwave.
F	00:07:24.330	00:07:27.300	and how about these cans of food?
A	00:07:27.300	00:07:35.460	these can go above the sink.
G	00:07:35.460	00:07:38.140	Mary! what about this bottle of soap?
A	00:07:38.140	00:07:40.770	that can go under the sink.
F	00:07:40.770	00:07:45.749	Wow, Mary. I think you've got enough stuff here for a whole month.
A	00:07:45.749	00:07:47.920	yes, I think so.
A	00:07:47.920	00:07:54.240	I don't want to have to go to the supermarket again for a long time.
G	00:07:54.240	00:07:57.960	Mary，how about the bread? where should I put the bread?
A	00:07:57.960	00:08:02.249	that can go above the microwave behind the fruit.
F	00:08:02.249	00:08:05.869	ok. I think that's what everything.
A	00:08:05.879	00:08:06.909	good.
A	00:08:06.909	00:08:10.210	you can throw the the bags in the trash can.
F	00:08:09.819	00:08:10.539	OK.
A	00:08:10.539	00:08:17.499	oh! thank you so much for asking me to join you to go to the supermarket today.
G	00:08:17.499	00:08:18.999	you're welcome.
G	00:08:18.999	00:08:33.840	and I'm sure David and Tina will be very happy too.

F	00:08:33.850	00:08:36.290	hello Joe's accounting firm.
F	00:08:36.290	00:08:37.660	how may I help you?
G	00:08:37.660	00:08:39.789	yeah, speak with Sue Williams please.
F	00:08:39.799	00:08:41.338	this is Sue speaking.
F	00:08:41.338	00:08:42.520	may I help you?
G	00:08:42.530	00:08:44.030	so this is kathy.
F	00:08:44.040	00:08:46.489	oh Kathy hi. what's up?
G	00:08:46.489	00:08:51.230	well, I was wondering if you and your family would like to go on vacation with us.
F	00:08:51.230	00:08:53.770	oh, we would love to go.
G	00:08:53.770	00:08:56.170	and the Wright family is going also.
F	00:08:56.170	00:08:58.400	great. where are you going?
G	00:08:58.400	00:08:59.979	we're going to Florida.
F	00:08:59.989	00:09:02.600	oh, that's very far away.
F	00:09:02.600	00:09:04.203	will you fly on a plane?
G	00:09:04.203	00:09:04.820	yes.
F	00:09:04.820	00:09:07.339	oh, I'm sorry.
F	00:09:07.339	00:09:08.699	I'm afraid we cannot go.
F	00:09:08.699	00:09:10.730	it would be too expensive for us.
G	00:09:10.730	00:09:14.369	but we have a very special price for the plane tickets.
G	00:09:14.369	00:09:17.039	it's really not very expensive.
F	00:09:17.049	00:09:19.700	well, when are you going?
F	00:09:19.700	00:09:21.230	the last week of June.
A	00:09:21.230	00:09:26.150	Oh! Kathy I'm sorry we're not free the last week of June.
B	00:09:26.150	00:09:28.900	oh, why?
A	00:09:28.900	00:09:30.890	Joe and I both have to work.
F	00:09:30.890	00:09:33.020	we don't have enough vacation time.
G	00:09:33.020	00:09:36.370	can you ask your boss for more vacation time?
G	00:09:36.370	00:09:41.620	no, it is very difficult for us to ask for a vacation time.
F	00:09:41.620	00:09:44.260	I'm sorry but we really cannot go.
G	00:09:44.270	00:09:46.720	are you sure you cannot go?
F	00:09:46.720	00:09:47.946	I'm sure.
F	00:09:47.946	00:09:50.060	it would be impossible for us to go.
G	00:09:50.060	00:09:52.900	I really wish you could go sue.
F	00:09:52.900	00:09:55.070	yes, so do I.

E	00:14:07.600	00:14:09.640	yes, I did.
E	00:14:09.640	00:14:13.190	she wants us to come and visit her for a few days.

E	00:14:14.620	00:14:16.720	yes, she does.
E	00:14:16.720	00:14:20.210	as a matter of fact, we're going tomorrow morning.
E	00:14:20.210	00:14:25.250	oh, so you need to start packing your suitcase right now dear.
D	00:14:25.250	00:14:26.830	I should?

E	00:14:29.470	00:14:33.873	do you have a problem with going to visit my mother?
D	00:14:33.873	00:14:37.580	oh, no, not at all.
D	00:14:37.580	00:14:40.090	I would love to visit your mother.
E	00:14:40.090	00:14:42.880	you would.
D	00:14:43.880	00:14:46.540	I guess it will be all right.
G	00:14:48.160	00:14:52.790	Sue, I'm so happy that you don't have to stay home all week.
G	00:14:52.790	00:14:57.450	going to visit your mother is a wonderful idea.
D	00:14:57.460	00:15:04.000	it is?

E	00:15:15.380	00:15:18.793	Joe, why do you look so upset?
D	00:15:18.793	00:15:25.590	I wanted to go to Florida with our friends.
D	00:15:25.590	00:15:28.460	I'm frustrated.
E	00:15:28.460	00:15:30.367	don't be upset.
E	00:15:30.367	00:15:31.950	we're going to visit my mother.
D	00:15:31.950	00:15:35.850	I know we're going to visit your mother.
D	00:15:35.850	00:15:38.630	that's why I'm upset.
E	00:15:38.630	00:15:51.620	and why don't you want to go visit my mother?
D	00:15:51.620	00:15:52.620	because.......
E	00:15:52.620	00:15:55.400	yes, because why?
D	00:15:55.400	00:15:59.630	because I don't know what to pack in my suitcase.
E	00:15:59.630	00:16:06.810	Joe, you have so many clothes so many nice things.
D	00:16:06.810	00:16:08.510	I know.
D	00:16:08.510	00:16:10.140	that's the problem.
D	00:16:10.140	00:16:12.690	I don't know what to take.
E	00:16:12.690	00:16:19.260	Oh, Joe here.
E	00:16:19.260	00:16:23.890	I'll help you decide what to take.
E	00:16:23.900	00:16:31.190	how about these blue pants?
E	00:16:31.190	00:16:34.400	you can take them when we go shopping with my mother.
D	00:16:34.410	00:16:40.640	ok.
D	00:16:40.640	00:16:50.480	and, well, I guess this red shirt would look nice with the blue pants.
D	00:16:50.590	00:16:51.357	yeah.
E	00:16:51.357	00:16:51.980	yeah.
E	00:16:51.990	00:16:52.769	that's good.
D	00:16:52.769	00:16:57.769	OK.
E	00:16:57.779	00:17:05.809	and I think you need to take a jacket or a sweater because the evenings will be cool.
D	00:17:05.809	00:17:10.549	well, should I take?
D	00:17:10.549	00:17:18.689	the large tan jacket or should I take the small green sweater?
E	00:17:19.650	00:17:21.699	I think this will be enough.
D	00:17:21.709	00:17:24.039	you think so?
D	00:17:24.049	00:17:27.919	ok, the small green sweater.
D	00:17:27.919	00:17:28.949	ok.

E	00:17:43.850	00:17:48.199	should you take the black bikini?
E	00:17:48.199	00:17:57.830	or how about your yellow bathing suit?
D	00:17:57.840	00:18:00.299	I think the black bikini is better.
E	00:18:00.299	00:18:03.959	oh, I like the yellow bathing suit.
E	00:18:03.959	00:18:06.120	I think you should take this one.

E	00:18:09.829	00:18:12.079	alright, ok.

D	00:18:23.299	00:18:28.640	should I take the brown shoes or the white shoes?
E	00:18:28.640	00:18:32.329	um, I think the white ones are better.
D	00:18:32.329	00:18:33.329	ok.
D	00:18:33.329	00:18:40.069	I think I can finish packing myself now.
