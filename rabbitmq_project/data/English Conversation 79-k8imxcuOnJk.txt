A	00:04:29.520	00:04:34.240	let me make you a quick snack to take away and you can eat it on your way there.
C	00:04:34.240	00:04:36.240	okay, yes, you're right.

C	00:05:26.479	00:05:28.000	a trekking holiday?
C	00:05:28.000	00:05:29.440	that's not very relaxing.
A	00:05:29.440	00:05:31.120	but it's different.
A	00:05:31.120	00:05:35.790	you don't have to take the bus and the tube and walk through busy streets.
A	00:05:36.800	00:05:40.710	even a sightseeing holiday sounds wonderful right now.
A	00:05:40.720	00:05:43.110	anything, just not here!
A	00:05:45.120	00:05:48.310	your sandwich is nearly ready.
A	00:05:48.320	00:05:50.960	would you like a quick glass of wine?
C	00:05:50.960	00:05:53.309	a glass of wine, just what i need.
A	00:06:00.319	00:06:03.990	a toast to your date.
C	00:06:04.000	00:06:05.759	and to your holiday!

A	00:06:55.120	00:07:00.390	you know lucy, the martini is more than just a cocktail.
A	00:07:00.400	00:07:03.039	it's an american icon.
A	00:07:03.039	00:07:12.639	and the preferred drink of such luminaries as franklin d roosevelt, jack london and ernest hemingway.
A	00:07:12.639	00:07:14.710	it celebrates the american dream.
D	00:07:14.720	00:07:17.909	yes, and winston churchill liked it, too.

G	00:15:43.680	00:15:45.199	oh, that's milton road, isn't it?
A	00:15:45.199	00:15:47.279	no, it's chancery lane.
A	00:15:47.279	00:15:51.440	the cocktail lounge is in front of a bank near the supermarket.
G	00:15:51.440	00:15:53.509	okay. good.
A	00:15:53.519	00:15:59.519	now, what about tasting this cocktail before leaving?
G	00:15:59.519	00:16:01.269	why not?
A	00:16:01.279	00:16:03.600	it's very simple.
A	00:16:03.600	00:16:15.150	you mix the vodka with blueberry syrup and a spray of lime and you shake everything with ice cubes.
G	00:16:20.160	00:16:23.269	i think i know this recipe.
A	00:16:23.279	00:16:27.990	yes! you garnish it with basil leaves.
A	00:16:28.000	00:16:35.069	and here's your mr cool, the coolest cocktail in town.

H	00:16:40.079	00:16:41.440	hi, mom!

H	00:16:47.680	00:16:50.399	ah, you're sitting in the backyard.
H	00:16:50.399	00:16:53.990	what's the weather like?
H	00:16:54.000	00:16:58.480	yes, i can see it's hot and sunny as usual.
H	00:16:58.480	00:17:02.150	no, here is raining.
H	00:17:02.160	00:17:05.679	yes, they have bad weather here all year long.
H	00:17:05.679	00:17:12.079	yesterday it was windy, the day before foggy and last week we even had some snow, too.
H	00:17:12.079	00:17:19.760	yes, yes, great britain is a wonderful place but the weather is awful and above all so unpredictable.
H	00:17:19.760	00:17:22.710	and most of the time it's cold.
H	00:17:22.720	00:17:27.199	they're heavily clad even in summer, well, almost.
H	00:17:27.199	00:17:31.350	yes, i really miss our sunny climate.
H	00:17:31.360	00:17:37.750	oh, no, you can't imagine how i'd like to wear a nice summer dress, sandals and no stockings!
H	00:17:39.760	00:17:43.110	ah yes, i i am happy here, very happy.
H	00:17:43.120	00:17:45.280	the Frases are really nice people.
H	00:17:45.280	00:17:49.039	and last week i helped miranda to prepare a thanksgiving dinner.
H	00:17:49.039	00:17:50.480	but to tell you the truth,
H	00:17:50.480	00:17:53.270	i did most of the cooking.
H	00:17:53.280	00:17:58.630	miranda is not the world's best cook.
I	00:17:58.640	00:17:59.600	hi, adriana.

H	00:18:08.799	00:18:12.150	yes, he's one of the fraser's friends.
H	00:18:12.160	00:18:16.880	oh! he's... uh, he's handsome.
H	00:18:16.880	00:18:21.190	he has a nice personality but he's a bit eccentric.
H	00:18:21.200	00:18:24.230	yeah, sometimes he gets hysterical for no reason, right?
I	00:18:26.240	00:18:27.600	is it your mother?
H	00:18:27.600	00:18:28.790	uh-huh.

A	00:19:48.320	00:19:56.029	yes, i would like to know if you have a twin room available from the fourth to the sixth of may, please.
K	00:19:57.039	00:19:58.950	let me check.
K	00:20:00.960	00:20:02.159	yes, we do.
A	00:20:02.159	00:20:03.990	how much is it per night?
K	00:20:04.000	00:20:07.430	it's a hundred fifty eight pounds per night.
A	00:20:07.440	00:20:10.470	has the room an ensuite bathroom?
K	00:20:10.480	00:20:14.470	all rooms in the hotel are ensuite.
A	00:20:14.480	00:20:18.230	is it possible to make a reservation right now?
K	00:20:18.240	00:20:19.360	sure, madam.
K	00:20:19.360	00:20:22.880	we need your credit card number and expiry date.
A	00:20:22.880	00:20:26.159	fine, just one last question.
A	00:20:26.159	00:20:32.950	we would like to bring hazel, lucille, my friend's pet rabbit with us.
A	00:20:32.960	00:20:34.720	is that a problem?
K	00:20:34.720	00:20:36.630	a rabbit?
K	00:20:36.640	00:20:40.070	madam, i'm afraid it is.
A	00:20:40.080	00:20:43.190	we promise he is very well behaved.
A	00:20:43.200	00:20:49.190	it is more or less like having a couple with a small baby.
K	00:20:49.200	00:20:50.320	i'm sorry.
K	00:20:50.320	00:20:53.669	but pets are not allowed in the hotel.
A	00:20:53.679	00:20:56.789	well, that's very unfair.
A	00:20:56.799	00:21:02.549	how is hazel going to feel when lucille has to tell him that he has to stay home?
K	00:21:04.559	00:21:06.270	i don't know, madam.
