B	00:02:30.030	00:02:31.630	eat more!
E	00:02:32.562	00:02:33.334	I can't.
E	00:02:33.637	00:02:35.173	the food is not that good.
F	00:02:36.053	00:02:37.297	excuse me?
A	00:02:37.599	00:02:40.069	Paul, what did you say?
E	00:02:41.748	00:02:42.494	nothing.
B	00:02:42.610	00:02:45.060	eat more, everyone.
D	00:02:45.060	00:02:48.660	Susie ayi, how did you cook the eggplant?
B	00:02:49.557	00:02:50.543	do you like it?
D	00:02:50.659	00:02:51.201	yes.
D	00:02:51.672	00:02:55.385	when my mom cooks eggplants, they're usually brown.
D	00:02:55.536	00:02:57.304	but these are purple.
B	00:02:58.077	00:03:01.391	i fry the eggplants in a wok with some vinegar.
B	00:03:02.066	00:03:04.243	then the eggplants stay purple.
C	00:03:05.007	00:03:08.037	my wife cooks the best Chinese food.
D	00:03:08.623	00:03:09.760	I know.
D	00:03:09.964	00:03:13.563	Susie Ayi, you really cooked a lot of dishes.
A	00:03:14.815	00:03:15.917	she did.
A	00:03:16.486	00:03:23.078	but you know, at a wedding banquet, there are often eight courses of food.
D	00:03:23.486	00:03:24.357	really?
D	00:03:24.668	00:03:28.248	if I went to one, I'd probably be stuffed!
D	00:03:28.657	00:03:30.292	why courses of food?
B	00:03:31.251	00:03:35.614	the number eight in Chinese sounds like good luck.
C	00:03:36.013	00:03:39.043	each dish has a special meaning, too.
D	00:03:39.292	00:03:41.273	that's very interesting.
A	00:03:41.566	00:03:44.302	ma, what's for dessert tonight?
B	00:03:44.622	00:03:48.718	I almost forgot,I made something special.

A	00:04:10.629	00:04:13.176	that's my coin, Paul!
E	00:04:13.625	00:04:14.687	no, it's not.
A	00:04:14.793	00:04:16.104	yes, it is.
E	00:04:16.264	00:04:17.734	the coin is cool.
E	00:04:18.054	00:04:18.867	it's gold.
A	00:04:19.524	00:04:20.768	give it back, Paul.
E	00:04:21.261	00:04:22.692	I can share with you.
A	00:04:23.527	00:04:25.881	but it's not yours to share.
A	00:04:26.108	00:04:27.209	it's mine.
B	00:04:27.351	00:04:29.044	Brian, it's okay.
B	00:04:29.000	00:04:31.490	if Paul wants to share, let him.
A	00:04:31.490	00:04:33.677	but it's not his!
C	00:04:34.223	00:04:36.360	both of you can have it.
E	00:04:37.430	00:04:40.090	Brian, we can play with it together.
A	00:04:40.090	00:04:44.711	Paul, my teacher gave the coin to me.
A	00:04:45.107	00:04:45.995	you were there.
C	00:04:46.786	00:04:48.212	is that true, Paul?
E	00:04:48.558	00:04:51.530	no,mr. Lee gave it to me.
A	00:04:52.454	00:04:55.035	when did you take it from me, Paul?
E	00:04:55.408	00:04:57.092	what are you talking about?
C	00:04:57.718	00:05:00.925	when did mr. Lee give the coin to you, Paul?
E	00:05:01.476	00:05:02.262	let me think...
E	00:05:04.532	00:05:07.255	he gave it to me on April thirty first.
D	00:05:08.050	00:05:14.600	then Paul is not the real owner.
D	00:05:14.610	00:05:17.240	the real owner is Brian.
B	00:05:17.240	00:05:19.490	how do you know, Patty?
D	00:05:19.490	00:05:27.560	because there is no April  thirty first. the month of April only has thirty days.
C	00:05:28.418	00:05:29.280	that's right.
E	00:05:30.035	00:05:30.452	fine.
E	00:05:30.563	00:05:31.887	take your coin.
B	00:05:31.971	00:05:32.966	oh my!
A	00:05:33.304	00:05:33.979	paul.
E	00:05:34.899	00:05:36.103	I'm sorry,okay?
E	00:05:36.254	00:05:37.071	sorry!
A	00:05:41.287	00:05:43.979	I really don't like Paul.
C	00:05:44.316	00:05:46.235	does he pick on you a lot?
A	00:05:47.164	00:05:50.193	yes,well, no.
A	00:05:50.362	00:05:51.148	not really.
A	00:05:51.926	00:05:53.365	he gets picked on, too.
C	00:05:54.937	00:05:56.910	Paul just needs help sometimes.
C	00:05:57.203	00:05:58.202	we all do.
D	00:05:59.024	00:06:00.614	he wasn't very polite.
C	00:06:01.201	00:06:04.910	no.I think Paul is angry and sad.
C	00:06:05.261	00:06:07.553	his parents aren't home very much.
B	00:06:07.895	00:06:11.356	so we often invite him to eat dinner with us.
A	00:06:12.066	00:06:13.905	I try to be nice.
A	00:06:14.407	00:06:17.837	but sometimes, it's hard.
C	00:06:18.290	00:06:20.435	I'm glad you try, Brian.
C	00:06:20.893	00:06:22.616	Paul is a good kid.
D	00:06:24.162	00:06:25.526	Paul was rude.
B	00:06:25.713	00:06:26.401	yes.
B	00:06:26.717	00:06:29.049	but we need to be kind anyway.
B	00:06:29.995	00:06:33.340	we are nice to everyone all the time, either.
D	00:06:33.704	00:06:36.947	no,you're right, Susie ayi.
B	00:06:37.911	00:06:40.572	well, I'll call Paul's mother later.
D	00:06:41.531	00:06:42.660	Susie ayi
D	00:06:43.397	00:06:44.476	I can clean up.
B	00:06:44.614	00:06:45.400	no, no.
A	00:06:46.009	00:06:48.519	mom, you've had a long day.
A	00:06:49.323	00:06:50.007	we'll clean.
B	00:06:50.993	00:06:51.628	okay.
B	00:06:54.742	00:06:55.555	thank you.
D	00:06:56.355	00:06:58.314	thank you, Susie ayi.
D	00:06:58.656	00:07:00.428	dinner was so good!

G	00:08:34.322	00:08:38.147	our train arrives back at hua Lian's station around  five thirty p.m.

D	00:08:43.180	00:08:45.254	this is a nice train station.
D	00:08:45.663	00:08:47.311	where is everyone traveling?
A	00:08:47.853	00:08:49.448	all over Taiwan.
A	00:08:49.927	00:08:52.730	taking the train is very convenient.
A	00:08:53.188	00:08:55.791	we even have high-speed rail.
D	00:08:56.240	00:08:57.301	high-speed rail?
D	00:08:57.763	00:08:59.029	that sounds fun.
D	00:09:02.912	00:09:04.884	what are those two people yelling about?
A	00:09:05.937	00:09:07.034	let me find out.

D	00:09:09.828	00:09:12.120	is there a problem between the man and the woman?
A	00:09:12.818	00:09:13.786	it's interesting.
A	00:09:14.213	00:09:15.883	here's the man's story.
A	00:09:16.682	00:09:19.663	the woman sat beside him on the train.
A	00:09:20.005	00:09:22.995	then the man went to sleep, and she took his wallet.
D	00:09:23.483	00:09:24.132	did she?
A	00:09:24.945	00:09:26.082	she said no.
A	00:09:26.997	00:09:29.689	and she doesn't even remember this man.
A	00:09:30.578	00:09:35.508	the man was in seat fourty eight but she was in seat forty nine
G	00:09:37.263	00:09:38.596	is everything okay?

G	00:09:43.340	00:09:46.276	you have seat thirty eight and I have seat  forty.
D	00:09:46.814	00:09:48.888	but then we aren't beside each other.
G	00:09:49.297	00:09:50.279	sure we are.
G	00:09:50.629	00:09:53.113	all this seats with even numbers are together.
G	00:09:53.255	00:09:55.925	and all the seats with odd numbers are together.
D	00:09:56.133	00:09:56.857	wait a minute.
D	00:09:57.168	00:09:59.243	then the man is lying, Brian!

D	00:10:01.290	00:10:04.684	dear journal, I'm on the train!
D	00:10:04.938	00:10:08.389	Roger is sleeping, and Brian is listening to music.
D	00:10:08.944	00:10:10.384	I like my window seat.
D	00:10:10.521	00:10:13.351	something interesting happened at the train station.
D	00:10:14.053	00:10:18.668	a man lied about his missing wallet and blamed a woman for it.
D	00:10:19.179	00:10:23.697	but she didn't take his wallet because she did not sit beside him.
D	00:10:24.297	00:10:25.918	the women is okay now.
D	00:10:43.829	00:10:46.268	it's interesting to watch people.

D	00:10:49.715	00:10:51.309	others are reading.
D	00:10:51.665	00:10:54.756	and many are sleeping just like Roger.
D	00:10:55.454	00:10:57.257	I'm too excited to sleep!
D	00:10:57.830	00:11:00.123	I'm on my way to Taipei!
D	00:11:00.651	00:11:06.595	I can't wait to see Taipei one zero one and to meet Daisy, Rogers friend.
