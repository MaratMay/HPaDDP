B	00:05:17.143	00:05:20.608	I haven't had traditional tea like this for years.
B	00:05:21.171	00:05:23.695	we usually use tea bags in America.
C	00:05:24.328	00:05:27.847	are you sure you didn't burn your fingers, patty?
B	00:05:28.266	00:05:29.811	yeah, I'm okay.

D	00:05:33.314	00:05:37.547	these little tea cups gets really hot really fast.
B	00:05:37.605	00:05:38.789	I remember now.
C	00:05:39.602	00:05:41.193	how's your tea,patty.

F	00:05:51.671	00:05:56.246	ouch! Derek, you burned me!
E	00:05:56.443	00:05:56.800	what?
E	00:05:57.277	00:05:58.572	no, I didn't, Jim.
F	00:05:59.953	00:06:00.734	yes, you did.
F	00:06:01.351	00:06:03.081	you spilled a pot of tea on me!
F	00:06:03.973	00:06:04.992	look at my clothes!
F	00:06:05.786	00:06:06.887	they're all wet.
F	00:06:07.812	00:06:09.045	so is my arm!
E	00:06:10.653	00:06:12.087	I'm really sorry.
E	00:06:13.279	00:06:14.586	how did that happened?
E	00:06:14.812	00:06:16.551	I didn't touch your teapot.
F	00:06:17.517	00:06:18.318	yes, you did.
F	00:06:19.050	00:06:20.748	you are a terrible server!
F	00:06:21.562	00:06:22.848	you should be fired!
E	00:06:24.279	00:06:24.838	fired?
E	00:06:25.220	00:06:25.795	no!
E	00:06:26.062	00:06:27.929	I really need this job.

D	00:06:28.149	00:06:29.523	excuse me.
D	00:06:30.008	00:06:31.969	I'm sure it was just an accident.
F	00:06:32.688	00:06:33.506	how do you know?
F	00:06:34.008	00:06:35.097	did you see it happen?
D	00:06:35.718	00:06:38.291	well, no.
F	00:06:39.931	00:06:43.252	did anyone here see what happened?
F	00:06:45.961	00:06:47.058	that's what I thought.
D	00:06:48.037	00:06:51.288	Derek wouldn't spill hot tea on you on purpose!
F	00:06:51.407	00:06:53.027	well he did.
F	00:06:54.219	00:06:56.771	I am going to talk to your boss.
F	00:06:57.951	00:06:59.603	lao ban! lao ban!
B	00:07:02.709	00:07:06.459	excuse me, but Jim is lying!
B	00:07:06.459	00:07:08.239	dear Journal.
B	00:07:08.581	00:07:11.561	I'm having Taiwan adventures already!
B	00:07:11.951	00:07:16.382	grandma and Roger took me to a traditional tea house yesterday.
B	00:07:16.596	00:07:21.685	the building was beautiful, and the tea was delicious.
B	00:07:21.935	00:07:27.053	I liked drinking tea made from tea leaves instead of tea bags.
B	00:07:27.534	00:07:30.177	I also liked the blood rice cake.
B	00:07:30.617	00:07:32.310	it was yummy!
B	00:07:32.454	00:07:36.248	grandma told me about other tea houses she has been to.
B	00:07:36.408	00:07:44.539	she has lived in Taiwan for fifty years, so she's been to a lot of tea houses!
B	00:07:45.328	00:07:48.908	a really exciting thing happened at the tea house.
B	00:07:49.031	00:07:55.579	a customer, Jim, said that Derrick, our server, spilled hot tea on him and burned him.
B	00:07:55.986	00:07:58.522	but Jim didn't act like he was in pain.
B	00:07:58.966	00:08:02.966	also, if Jim's skin were burned, it should be red and hot.
B	00:08:03.471	00:08:05.765	his arm was wet but not red.
B	00:08:06.057	00:08:07.795	so I knew he lied.
B	00:08:08.346	00:08:10.422	then we checked Jim's table.
B	00:08:11.022	00:08:13.328	his pot of tea was almost full!
B	00:08:13.542	00:08:16.205	and we found a half empty water bottle.
B	00:08:16.300	00:08:18.770	Jim must have poured the water on himself.
B	00:08:20.258	00:08:23.074	we found out that Jim is jealous of Derek.
B	00:08:23.666	00:08:28.397	Jim wanted Derek's job, but the boss hired Derek instead of Jim.
B	00:08:29.227	00:08:30.937	well, I'm going to bed.
B	00:08:31.282	00:08:36.050	it's only eight o'clock, but jet lag is making me so tired!
B	00:08:36.646	00:08:38.447	the Taiwan traveler, patty.

C	00:08:45.650	00:08:47.576	here we are!
C	00:08:47.913	00:08:51.485	this is the entrance to taroko gorge.
B	00:08:52.069	00:08:53.404	what a pretty gate!
B	00:08:53.811	00:08:55.250	let's take some pictures.
G	00:08:55.969	00:08:59.048	okay! everyone stand over there.

C	00:09:05.986	00:09:08.321	okay, get in the car!
B	00:09:09.698	00:09:11.400	tell me more about the gorge.
B	00:09:11.651	00:09:12.740	what can we do here?
D	00:09:13.311	00:09:15.001	we can do lots of things!
G	00:09:16.887	00:09:18.260	we can hike.
D	00:09:18.626	00:09:21.544	yes, we can hike to some waterfalls.
B	00:09:21.836	00:09:22.564	okay!
G	00:09:23.028	00:09:27.776	there are some easy trails and some hard trails.
C	00:09:28.183	00:09:31.200	let's hike on the easy trails!
G	00:09:32.092	00:09:34.578	one trail is not far from here.
G	00:09:35.100	00:09:37.937	it goes to the eternal spring shrine.
B	00:09:38.446	00:09:39.782	can we hike that trail?
B	00:09:40.510	00:09:41.895	is it an easy trail?
D	00:09:42.195	00:09:43.695	sure! let's go!
B	00:09:52.208	00:09:54.054	what a beautiful view!

B	00:09:58.707	00:09:59.968	look at the water!
B	00:10:00.930	00:10:03.191	the shrine is over a waterfall.
B	00:10:03.503	00:10:04.568	that's cool!
G	00:10:05.024	00:10:06.870	I like this place.
B	00:10:07.264	00:10:19.102	it is so peaceful.
C	00:10:09.414	00:10:10.923	me too.
B	00:10:11.289	00:10:14.573	Brian, what does taroko mean?
G	00:10:15.136	00:10:18.934	it means beautiful and in the omni's language.
G	00:10:19.855	00:10:22.082	that's a good name for this place!
B	00:10:23.710	00:10:24.701	dear Journal!
B	00:10:25.071	00:10:30.673	today I went to taroko gorge with Grandma Roger and Brian.
B	00:10:32.202	00:10:34.225	what a beautiful place!
B	00:10:34.545	00:10:37.414	the gorge walls are so steep!
B	00:10:38.191	00:10:42.441	the gorge is part of Taiwan's cross-island highway.
B	00:10:42.466	00:10:46.194	workers built this highway in the ninteen fifties.
B	00:10:46.330	00:10:49.137	hundreds of workers died building it.
B	00:10:49.261	00:10:53.071	I saw their names at the eternal spring shrine.
B	00:10:53.893	00:10:57.646	taroko is the largest marble gorge in the world.
B	00:10:57.991	00:11:01.633	the road through it is next to the Li Wu River.
B	00:11:01.830	00:11:03.388	it's so pretty!
B	00:11:03.791	00:11:08.160	I loved looking up at the gorge walls and then down into the river.
B	00:11:09.504	00:11:12.332	I really liked the tunnel of nine turns.
B	00:11:12.764	00:11:15.111	some parts of the tunnel are open.
B	00:11:15.423	00:11:17.701	you can look down at the river.
B	00:11:17.881	00:11:22.292	and in some places the gorge is really narrow.
B	00:11:23.344	00:11:26.743	the mountains around here are really beautiful.
B	00:11:26.998	00:11:31.364	they are so different from the mountains. at home in Colorado.
B	00:11:31.849	00:11:37.213	mountains here are not as high, and they have a lot more trees.
B	00:11:37.607	00:11:41.011	tonight we are staying in a hotel in the gorge.
B	00:11:41.368	00:11:45.799	tomorrow we'll hike more and visit another waterfall.
B	00:11:46.120	00:11:49.988	Brian told me about so many beautiful places here.
B	00:11:50.296	00:11:51.981	I want to see them all!

D	00:11:55.742	00:11:56.807	good morning, Patty!
D	00:11:57.345	00:11:58.246	did you sleep well?

B	00:12:02.249	00:12:04.136	which waterfall are we going to see?
D	00:12:04.481	00:12:07.157	grandma wants to hike to buy a young waterfall.
B	00:12:07.687	00:12:08.793	is that a long hike?
D	00:12:09.788	00:12:13.290	no,but you begin the hike with a walk through a tunnel.
B	00:12:13.841	00:12:14.490	fun!
B	00:12:14.794	00:12:16.290	where Brian and grandma?
D	00:12:16.981	00:12:18.773	they're still eating breakfast.
D	00:12:19.217	00:12:20.832	brian is a slow eater.
C	00:12:26.957	00:12:27.972	we're here!
D	00:12:29.727	00:12:32.157	how many mantou did you eat, Brian?
G	00:12:32.720	00:12:33.723	only four.
C	00:12:34.208	00:12:35.215	that's a lot!
D	00:12:35.692	00:12:37.163	well let's go!
C	00:12:37.492	00:12:41.652	okay we'll drive about three hundred meters.
C	00:12:41.734	00:12:45.807	then we walk through a long tunnel.
B	00:12:46.083	00:12:47.488	are there lights in the tunnel?
G	00:12:47.969	00:12:50.740	no. we'll walk in the dark.
G	00:12:51.019	00:12:52.853	it will be an adventure!
B	00:12:55.228	00:12:56.556	okay.
C	00:12:58.792	00:13:00.317	don't worry, patty.
C	00:13:01.686	00:13:03.720	I brought flashlights!

B	00:13:36.998	00:13:39.156	what are we going to do now?
G	00:13:40.468	00:13:42.404	we'll take another hike.
G	00:13:42.823	00:13:44.426	are you tired of hiking yet?
B	00:13:44.300	00:13:45.260	oh, no!
B	00:13:44.788	00:13:47.003	I love to hike.
B	00:13:47.114	00:13:49.120	I love mountain scenery.
C	00:13:49.182	00:13:52.630	then let's hike the mystery valley trail.
C	00:13:52.902	00:13:56.136	the scenery is very pretty there.
G	00:13:56.515	00:13:58.936	it's also an easy hike!
G	00:13:59.507	00:14:03.465	but that trail is now called Sa ca dan trail.
C	00:14:03.712	00:14:05.212	oh that's right.
C	00:14:05.521	00:14:07.687	the name changed.
C	00:14:07.736	00:14:09.804	well, get in the car.
C	00:14:10.046	00:14:12.558	we need to drive to the trailhead.

G	00:14:37.290	00:14:39.197	no, sorry.
G	00:14:39.715	00:14:42.868	swimming here is too dangerous.
C	00:14:43.382	00:14:48.935	on the way back, we'll stop at the bridge of motherly devotion.
C	00:14:49.432	00:14:54.582	we can go down to the river there and put our seat in the water!
B	00:14:54.911	00:14:57.193	that's a strange name for a bridge!
C	00:14:57.279	00:14:58.138	maybe.
C	00:14:58.590	00:15:00.777	but it's beautiful!
G	00:15:03.469	00:15:07.991	Wow I've seen enough scenery for one day.

D	00:15:38.880	00:15:40.438	she looks upset.
D	00:15:40.880	00:15:42.724	she's yelling for help.

H	00:15:53.086	00:15:55.100	He's getting away with my camera!

H	00:16:00.711	00:16:03.325	I took some pictures of those big rocks.
H	00:16:03.411	00:16:06.054	then I saw that boy coming toward me.
G	00:16:06.387	00:16:08.825	and what did he do?
H	00:16:09.026	00:16:11.143	he pushed me down into the dirt.
H	00:16:11.242	00:16:13.186	then he took my camera!
B	00:16:13.675	00:16:15.110	that's terrible!
H	00:16:15.163	00:16:17.600	please get my camera back for me!

D	00:16:43.007	00:16:45.403	he says this is his camera!
H	00:16:45.543	00:16:47.857	it's not,is my camera.
C	00:16:48.145	00:16:50.788	who is telling the truth?
B	00:16:49.770	00:16:53.260	I know.
D	00:16:55.527	00:16:58.544	I can't believe that girl lied to us!
B	00:16:58.668	00:17:00.731	she thought she could fool us.
C	00:17:00.945	00:17:02.774	she fooled me!
B	00:17:03.144	00:17:04.110	not me.
B	00:17:04.365	00:17:06.593	she said she fell in the dirt.
B	00:17:06.617	00:17:09.182	but her pants were spotless!
D	00:17:09.577	00:17:12.113	she was really upset when you told her that!
C	00:17:12.664	00:17:14.304	she was.
C	00:17:14.571	00:17:17.510	but I hope she learned her lesson!
