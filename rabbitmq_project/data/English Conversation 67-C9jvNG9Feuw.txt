A	00:14:58.800	00:15:01.760	did we go by car?
F	00:15:01.760	00:15:03.600	oh, no, we didn't.
F	00:15:03.600	00:15:06.310	we went by train.
F	00:15:06.320	00:15:11.990	and at the very last moment, peter didn't come because of the audition.

F	00:15:20.800	00:15:24.949	oh, that's frank, a friend of mine.
F	00:15:24.959	00:15:28.389	i met him on holiday in norway.
F	00:15:28.399	00:15:31.829	we had a good time together.
A	00:15:31.839	00:15:34.639	and?
F	00:15:34.639	00:15:40.710	afterwards he went his way and i went my way.
A	00:15:40.720	00:15:44.710	yeah, that's life!
A	00:15:44.720	00:15:46.639	did you have an affair with him?
F	00:15:46.639	00:15:49.279	no, no, i didn't.
F	00:15:49.279	00:15:51.279	nothing like that.
F	00:15:51.279	00:15:54.000	and we were only good friends!

F	00:15:56.240	00:15:59.269	no, we don't.
F	00:15:59.279	00:16:02.949	he wrote me a letter five years ago.
F	00:16:02.959	00:16:06.230	he sent me an invitation to his wedding.

A	00:16:26.800	00:16:33.030	do you mind, anne, if i keep this picture with me?
F	00:16:33.040	00:16:35.519	i, i do mind!

A	00:17:18.319	00:17:20.949	everything is just fine!
D	00:17:20.959	00:17:24.390	really?
D	00:17:24.400	00:17:31.919	i don't think so.
D	00:17:31.919	00:17:34.480	come on, tell me what's happening.
D	00:17:34.480	00:17:37.039	some problems with peter?
A	00:17:37.039	00:17:38.630	no!
A	00:17:38.640	00:17:40.960	well, yes!
A	00:17:40.960	00:17:44.470	but i don't think you're the right person to talk with!
D	00:17:44.480	00:17:47.360	maybe you're right.
D	00:17:47.360	00:17:51.440	but i can't stand seeing you so sad!
D	00:17:51.440	00:17:52.310	and this?
D	00:17:52.320	00:17:55.200	what does it mean?
A	00:17:55.200	00:17:55.679	don't worry!
A	00:17:55.679	00:17:57.350	i'm not leaving forever!
A	00:17:57.360	00:18:00.950	my colleague lucy invited me to spend the weekend at her house.
A	00:18:00.960	00:18:04.549	she has a cottage in the countryside near brighton.
A	00:18:04.559	00:18:07.830	we are leaving in the evening, right after work!
D	00:18:07.840	00:18:10.720	the countryside is lovely there!
A	00:18:10.720	00:18:12.080	i hope so!
A	00:18:12.080	00:18:15.190	i need a break!
A	00:18:15.200	00:18:18.789	living with peter is getting hard!
A	00:18:18.799	00:18:22.470	he's so nervous about his concert.
A	00:18:22.480	00:18:25.830	he can only think and talk about that!
A	00:18:25.840	00:18:28.000	he seems miles away!
A	00:18:28.000	00:18:32.160	and as for his music, he's excessive.
A	00:18:32.160	00:18:36.559	he goes on singing all day long!
A	00:18:36.559	00:18:38.880	he doesn't speak with me anymore.
A	00:18:38.880	00:18:41.679	he sings with me.
A	00:18:41.679	00:18:48.630	"sharon can you pass me the salt, please?"
D	00:18:48.640	00:18:54.150	i like it when you smile!
D	00:18:54.160	00:19:00.789	i think a weekend in the countryside is exactly what you need!
A	00:19:00.799	00:19:03.120	i didn't know you liked the country so much.
D	00:19:03.120	00:19:04.630	are you joking?
D	00:19:04.640	00:19:10.960	i love the countryside, it's so quiet and relaxing.
A	00:19:10.960	00:19:13.110	a lot of people think it's boring.
D	00:19:13.120	00:19:18.230	well, they don't know what they're missing.
A	00:19:18.240	00:19:19.200	what, jack?
A	00:19:19.200	00:19:21.590	are you using cliches now?
D	00:19:21.600	00:19:25.750	like the countryside is safe and the city is dangerous?
A	00:19:25.760	00:19:28.559	or: the country is clean and the city is dirty?
D	00:19:28.559	00:19:31.840	and don't forget the country is cheap, too!
A	00:19:31.840	00:19:35.510	yes, there's that, too.
A	00:19:35.520	00:19:38.320	the city is very expensive.
A	00:19:38.320	00:19:40.789	just think how much the rent is for this apartment!
D	00:19:40.799	00:19:42.080	don't remind me!
D	00:19:42.080	00:19:45.669	i have to pay mine tomorrow morning!
A	00:19:45.679	00:19:48.080	well, jack!
A	00:19:48.080	00:19:50.230	it was good talking with you!
A	00:19:50.240	00:19:54.549	you make me laugh!
A	00:19:54.559	00:20:03.350	sometimes, i think about us about how we were together once.
D	00:20:03.360	00:20:10.710	we were, we are a wonderful couple!
D	00:20:10.720	00:20:13.520	don't forget it!
A	00:20:13.520	00:20:14.180	alright!

F	00:20:18.400	00:20:19.440	oh, hi, jack.

F	00:20:26.799	00:20:28.880	can i ask you a question?
D	00:20:28.880	00:20:31.510	sure, how can i help you?
F	00:20:31.520	00:20:35.190	well, i need your advice.
F	00:20:35.200	00:20:37.280	i want to buy a new car.
D	00:20:37.280	00:20:42.149	ah, you should buy a fast, expensive sports car!
F	00:20:42.159	00:20:47.270	come on, i can't afford a sports car.
F	00:20:47.280	00:20:54.870	my car's old, it's too big and it's difficult to drive.
D	00:20:54.880	00:20:57.200	very good reasons to buy a new car.
F	00:20:57.200	00:20:58.870	yes!
F	00:20:58.880	00:21:07.909	i'd like to buy a small, stylish car that's not too expensive.
D	00:21:07.919	00:21:13.520	a small, stylish car that's not too expensive.
F	00:21:13.520	00:21:15.520	and for young people!
D	00:21:15.520	00:21:20.070	of course, you shouldn't buy a car for old people.
F	00:21:20.080	00:21:23.350	so, what car should i buy?
F	00:21:23.360	00:21:27.190	i don't understand anything about cars!
D	00:21:27.200	00:21:32.070	well, what about buying a ferrari?
F	00:21:32.080	00:21:34.320	are you joking?
D	00:21:34.320	00:21:36.390	just kidding.
D	00:21:36.400	00:21:39.360	let me think.
D	00:21:39.360	00:21:43.110	oh, can i have a look?
D	00:21:43.120	00:21:47.750	how about this car?
F	00:21:47.760	00:21:50.240	it's nice!
F	00:21:50.240	00:21:52.720	isn't it expensive?
D	00:21:52.720	00:21:56.159	all cars are expensive these days.

D	00:21:56.159	00:22:00.549	by the way, did you hear about sharon?
F	00:22:00.559	00:22:04.549	yes, i met peter in the afternoon.
F	00:22:04.559	00:22:07.200	he told me they had a quarrel.
F	00:22:07.200	00:22:10.149	but i don't think we should worry about it!
F	00:22:10.159	00:22:11.350	do you?
D	00:22:11.360	00:22:15.510	um, maybe we should.
D	00:22:15.520	00:22:22.630	what do you think of sharon, anne?
F	00:22:22.640	00:22:25.440	she's very pretty.
D	00:22:25.440	00:22:29.909	yes, she is.
F	00:22:29.919	00:22:33.190	what about me, jack?
F	00:22:33.200	00:22:35.159	do you think i'm good-looking?
D	00:22:35.200	00:22:39.440	come on anne, you are very attractive!
F	00:22:39.440	00:22:41.510	do you really think so?
D	00:22:41.520	00:22:43.440	yes, anne.
D	00:22:43.440	00:22:46.559	you are always on my mind!
F	00:22:46.559	00:22:46.960	oh!
D	00:22:46.960	00:22:50.710	oh, i'm sorry.
