A	00:00:08.607	00:00:09.914	I love the beach.
B	00:00:10.023	00:00:11.202	ME, TOO.
A	00:00:11.160	00:00:15.264	hey, Roger, does this beach have cute lifeguards?
C	00:00:15.120	00:00:17.630	I don't know.
A	00:00:18.519	00:00:19.491	how do I say?
A	00:00:19.810	00:00:22.613	help! I'm drowning,in Chinese?
C	00:00:23.006	00:00:25.458	you can just say, JIU Ming!
B	00:00:26.079	00:00:27.522	can you swim, patty?
A	00:00:28.204	00:00:28.906	yes.
A	00:00:29.292	00:00:33.555	but maybe I can practice Chinese with a cute lifeguard.
B	00:00:33.841	00:00:35.235	Oh, patty!

A	00:00:40.834	00:00:43.063	do you need some sunscreen, Daisy?
A	00:00:43.510	00:00:45.449	I can put it on your back for you.
B	00:00:45.572	00:00:47.268	no thanks.
B	00:00:47.531	00:00:49.171	I want a tan first.
A	00:00:49.400	00:00:50.652	why?
B	00:00:50.780	00:00:52.850	my skin is too white!
A	00:00:52.820	00:00:55.828	Roger, do you want some sunscreen?
C	00:00:55.985	00:00:56.840	not yet.
C	00:00:57.049	00:00:58.894	I'm going in the water first!
C	00:00:59.047	00:01:00.795	are you girls coming?
C	00:01:01.898	00:01:02.656	let's go!
A	00:01:16.103	00:01:17.499	that was fun!
A	00:01:17.664	00:01:19.075	I love the ocean.
C	00:01:19.608	00:01:20.630	me too.
C	00:01:21.030	00:01:22.277	swimming is fun.
B	00:01:23.155	00:01:25.245	I like swimming in a pool better, though.
B	00:01:25.663	00:01:28.693	the water is cleaner, and it doesn't have salt in it.
C	00:01:28.999	00:01:32.123	well, you don't have to drink the ocean water.
B	00:01:32.624	00:01:34.441	I didn't try to drink it.
B	00:01:34.708	00:01:36.187	you splashed me.
B	00:01:36.555	00:01:38.368	the water went into my mouth.
C	00:01:38.833	00:01:39.925	I'm sorry.
B	00:01:39.963	00:01:41.024	no, you're not.
C	00:01:41.693	00:01:42.623	you're right.
A	00:01:50.350	00:01:54.330	there aren't very many people in the ocean today.
C	00:01:54.340	00:01:57.639	maybe Chinese people don't like to swim.
B	00:01:57.905	00:01:59.297	no, you're wrong.
B	00:01:59.180	00:02:02.741	I see Chinese people at the pool all the time.
B	00:02:02.870	00:02:05.143	some of them are great swimmers.
C	00:02:05.489	00:02:09.589	oh, well, maybe they're not here to swim.
C	00:02:10.000	00:02:13.295	maybe they just come to the beach to have fun.
B	00:02:13.380	00:02:15.754	that's why we're here!
A	00:02:19.335	00:02:22.747	hey, guys, let's go for a walk along the beach!
C	00:02:22.912	00:02:23.761	ok.
B	00:02:24.883	00:02:28.275	I'm going to lie here on my towel a little longer.
B	00:02:28.388	00:02:29.402	I want a tan.
C	00:02:29.788	00:02:31.031	come on!
C	00:02:31.438	00:02:35.630	you can go with us and get a tan at the same time.
B	00:02:36.214	00:02:38.073	oh, all right.
A	00:02:38.435	00:02:42.901	but first, you both really need to put on some suntan lotion!
C	00:02:49.238	00:02:51.254	that was a fun walk, patty.
C	00:02:51.878	00:02:55.129	but the rocks on the beach hurt my feet.
B	00:02:55.205	00:02:56.988	why don't you wear sandals?
B	00:02:57.036	00:02:58.384	I told you too.
C	00:02:58.887	00:03:00.601	and I'm hot, too.
C	00:03:00.746	00:03:03.112	we walked a long time.
A	00:03:03.454	00:03:04.512	we did.
A	00:03:04.951	00:03:07.296	but I found some pretty rocks.
C	00:03:07.763	00:03:08.805	I'm glad.
C	00:03:09.099	00:03:10.652	but let's go swimming now.
C	00:03:10.906	00:03:12.250	I want to cool down.
B	00:03:12.616	00:03:14.137	that sounds good.
B	00:03:14.237	00:03:15.613	let's go swimming again.
A	00:03:15.678	00:03:16.060	wait.
A	00:03:17.231	00:03:18.643	take my picture first.
B	00:03:18.659	00:03:19.138	ok.
C	00:03:25.817	00:03:28.441	patty, are you coming with us?
A	00:03:28.670	00:03:33.060	no, I want to look for more pretty rocks now.
B	00:03:33.527	00:03:34.685	do you collect them?
A	00:03:34.620	00:03:35.670	yes.
A	00:03:36.536	00:03:41.083	my brother and I always collect shells and rocks when we go to the beach.
B	00:03:41.711	00:03:42.302	fun.
C	00:03:42.684	00:03:44.020	do you want some help?
C	00:03:44.169	00:03:46.245	we can look for more rocks with you.
A	00:03:47.287	00:03:48.156	that's ok.
A	00:03:48.382	00:03:49.565	you too go swimming.
A	00:04:01.286	00:04:01.777	OH!
A	00:04:01.954	00:04:03.028	oh! sorry!
A	00:04:03.487	00:04:06.838	I mean, DUI BuQI.
D	00:04:07.100	00:04:07.800	mei guan xi.
D	00:04:08.094	00:04:08.979	are you ok?
A	00:04:09.200	00:04:11.304	oh, you speak English!
A	00:04:11.723	00:04:13.686	hey, do I know you?
D	00:04:14.049	00:04:14.588	yes!
D	00:04:14.890	00:04:15.606	hello, Patti!
D	00:04:15.932	00:04:16.551	I'm Derrick.
D	00:04:16.748	00:04:18.463	you saw me at the teahouse.
A	00:04:18.929	00:04:19.996	oh, right!
A	00:04:20.209	00:04:20.752	hi!
A	00:04:21.199	00:04:23.496	you look different with sunglasses on.
A	00:04:24.027	00:04:25.592	sorry to bump into you.
D	00:04:25.761	00:04:26.361	that's ok.
A	00:04:26.997	00:04:28.638	are you looking for rocks, too?
D	00:04:29.286	00:04:30.992	no, I'm looking for my watch.
D	00:04:31.382	00:04:32.469	I lost it.
A	00:04:32.750	00:04:33.889	I'm sorry.
A	00:04:34.187	00:04:36.163	hey, I can help you.
A	00:04:36.215	00:04:38.130	we can look for it together.
D	00:04:38.162	00:04:39.120	ok,thanks!
A	00:04:43.638	00:04:46.918	I'm sorry you didn't find your watch, Derrick.
D	00:04:47.328	00:04:49.505	I'll look for it again after we eat.
C	00:04:49.815	00:04:50.990	we'll help you, too.
D	00:04:51.376	00:04:51.903	thanks.
B	00:04:52.680	00:04:55.424	hmm, this sandwich is so good!
C	00:04:55.742	00:04:57.045	yes, it is.
A	00:04:57.222	00:05:01.600	Daisy, I'm so glad you could come down from Taipei this weekend.
B	00:05:01.684	00:05:02.586	me, too.
B	00:05:02.839	00:05:04.658	I've had a lot of fun today.
C	00:05:05.153	00:05:07.338	and Derrick, thanks for joining our picnic.
D	00:05:07.511	00:05:08.569	thanks for inviting me.
A	00:05:11.325	00:05:12.866	do we have any more ice?
A	00:05:12.943	00:05:14.359	my drink is warm.
C	00:05:15.248	00:05:16.986	no, sorry.
D	00:05:17.457	00:05:19.630	I'll go to the store and got some for you, patty.
A	00:05:19.948	00:05:22.764	oh well, I'll go with you.
A	00:05:25.537	00:05:27.637	that girl is pretty.
A	00:05:28.164	00:05:30.337	Daisy would like her tan.
D	00:05:30.876	00:05:31.411	hey!
D	00:05:31.902	00:05:33.234	her watch looks like mine.
B	00:05:34.364	00:05:37.253	really? maybe it is yours!
D	00:05:37.817	00:05:38.847	I I don't know.
A	00:05:39.664	00:05:40.501	let's find out.
A	00:05:40.529	00:05:41.285	come on.
A	00:05:44.820	00:05:46.242	excuse me.
A	00:05:46.447	00:05:47.675	what time is it?
E	00:05:48.753	00:05:49.799	it's five o'clock.
A	00:05:50.053	00:05:50.652	thanks.
A	00:05:51.409	00:05:53.231	that's very nice watch.
A	00:05:53.368	00:05:54.265	may I see it?
E	00:05:54.732	00:05:55.569	ok.
D	00:05:56.064	00:05:57.875	Patty, what are you doing?
A	00:05:57.923	00:05:59.041	just trust me.
A	00:06:00.341	00:06:02.264	do you wear your watch very often?
E	00:06:02.824	00:06:04.067	I wear it all the time.
A	00:06:04.304	00:06:05.133	even today?
A	00:06:05.455	00:06:06.497	outside, in the Sun?
E	00:06:07.137	00:06:07.845	yes.
A	00:06:08.376	00:06:11.800	so your skin is probably white where the watch would be?
A	00:06:13.229	00:06:14.810	just give me my watch back!
E	00:06:14.935	00:06:15.478	no.
A	00:06:15.530	00:06:16.798	this isn't your watch.

A	00:06:25.078	00:06:26.873	so, where are we going?
F	00:06:27.275	00:06:29.907	we're going to a special place.
A	00:06:30.164	00:06:31.062	I know.
A	00:06:31.480	00:06:33.786	but what kind of special place is it?
A	00:06:34.458	00:06:35.701	is it a restaurant?
A	00:06:35.854	00:06:36.337	oh!
A	00:06:36.715	00:06:38.369	are we going to a buffet?
C	00:06:38.405	00:06:39.523	a buffet?
C	00:06:40.046	00:06:41.262	are you hungry?
A	00:06:41.869	00:06:42.593	no.
A	00:06:42.811	00:06:44.352	but I am curious.
C	00:06:45.237	00:06:47.884	Patty, this isn't a mystery.
C	00:06:47.957	00:06:49.538	just enjoy the day.
A	00:06:50.009	00:06:50.992	ok.
A	00:06:55.384	00:06:56.676	are we going to a party?

B	00:09:20.292	00:09:21.338	it's a mall.
A	00:09:21.467	00:09:22.646	no way!
A	00:09:22.694	00:09:24.142	I love malls!
C	00:09:24.569	00:09:25.458	we know.

A	00:09:27.985	00:09:29.114	let's go!
A	00:09:32.960	00:09:35.556	is that a ferris wheel on top of the building?
B	00:09:35.600	00:09:36.914	yes, it is.
B	00:09:37.097	00:09:39.607	if you want to, we can ride it later.
A	00:09:40.295	00:09:41.289	I want to!
C	00:09:41.921	00:09:42.510	ok.
C	00:09:42.784	00:09:45.339	but first, let's get tickets for our movie.

H	00:11:23.958	00:11:24.749	I'm sure.
H	00:11:24.854	00:11:26.626	I saw his red t-shirt.
B	00:11:27.300	00:11:28.950	when did this happen?
H	00:11:29.608	00:11:33.251	this happened ten minutes ago at two o'clock.
H	00:11:33.716	00:11:36.094	I looked at my watch when he bumped into me.
A	00:11:36.752	00:11:38.621	I'm sorry about your shirt, sir.
A	00:11:38.979	00:11:40.791	but you have the wrong guy.
A	00:11:41.222	00:11:43.377	Roger couldn't have bumped into you.

A	00:11:52.070	00:11:54.166	yes, mom, I'm fine.

A	00:12:01.960	00:12:02.527	bye!
F	00:12:06.539	00:12:08.589	how is your mother?
A	00:12:08.907	00:12:09.918	she's fine
A	00:12:10.035	00:12:11.888	but she misses me.
F	00:12:12.204	00:12:14.489	and you miss her.
A	00:12:15.481	00:12:18.183	well, yes.
A	00:12:18.895	00:12:21.436	but I'm also having a lot of fun.
A	00:12:21.935	00:12:24.504	there are so many interesting things here!

F	00:12:27.751	00:12:30.809	we're going back to taroko gorge!
A	00:12:31.085	00:12:33.557	I love the gorge!
F	00:12:33.932	00:12:35.064	I know.
F	00:12:35.499	00:12:40.120	but today we're going to an Aboriginal village for tourists.
F	00:12:40.305	00:12:42.637	we can learn about their culture.
A	00:12:44.880	00:12:47.471	are there many Aboriginal tribes on Taiwan?
F	00:12:47.847	00:12:50.503	there are thirteen tribes.
F	00:12:50.863	00:12:55.430	we are visiting a village of the taroko tribe today.
A	00:12:55.993	00:12:57.259	what can we do there?
F	00:12:57.615	00:13:02.129	we can eat some Aboriginal food and watch dances.
A	00:13:02.355	00:13:03.741	that sounds fun!

C	00:13:11.947	00:13:13.104	where is Brian?
F	00:13:13.589	00:13:16.109	we're meeting him at his house.
A	00:13:16.624	00:13:18.417	does he know a lot about the village?
C	00:13:18.680	00:13:21.012	he knows a lot about everything!
F	00:13:21.439	00:13:23.823	you can see a lot there.
F	00:13:24.145	00:13:26.488	and you can shop, too.
A	00:13:27.003	00:13:27.685	shop?
C	00:13:28.011	00:13:28.516	yes.
C	00:13:29.039	00:13:31.192	you can buy some arts and crafts.
A	00:13:31.816	00:13:34.371	I can buy some for my family at home!

F	00:13:49.681	00:13:51.010	here we are!
A	00:13:51.433	00:13:53.016	what a beautiful place!
A	00:13:53.577	00:13:55.265	everything is so green.
A	00:13:55.760	00:13:57.488	I want to see everything!
F	00:13:58.291	00:13:59.480	you will.
F	00:13:59.993	00:14:02.208	let's start at the Visitor Center.
F	00:14:02.586	00:14:05.210	you can see a lot of things there.
I	00:14:05.835	00:14:11.358	yes, you'll wants to see the presentation about the Aborigines.
I	00:14:11.748	00:14:13.010	you'll learn a lot.
A	00:14:13.488	00:14:14.001	great!
A	00:14:14.595	00:14:17.426	but what can Brian the brain tell me about them?
I	00:14:19.816	00:14:27.068	there are over four hundred and fifty thousand Aborigines on Thailand now.
I	00:14:27.664	00:14:30.816	they came here many years ago.
F	00:14:31.524	00:14:34.542	some live here in the mountains.
F	00:14:34.647	00:14:36.697	others live on the plains.
A	00:14:37.113	00:14:38.302	what did they do?
I	00:14:38.841	00:14:40.867	they fished or hunted.
I	00:14:41.145	00:14:43.680	they also did some farming, too.
F	00:14:44.124	00:14:48.969	and some of the mountain tribes were headhunters!
A	00:14:49.329	00:14:52.210	but they don't hunt heads anymore.
A	00:14:52.846	00:14:53.331	right?
I	00:14:54.222	00:14:55.721	of course not!
I	00:14:56.620	00:14:58.475	the presentation will talk about it.
C	00:15:03.722	00:15:06.045	are the taroko a large tribe?
I	00:15:06.343	00:15:09.445	no,they're a small tribe.
I	00:15:09.934	00:15:12.519	the amis are a large tribe.
I	00:15:12.881	00:15:16.829	many of them also lived in the haulin area.
F	00:15:17.555	00:15:21.494	they have a big harvest festival every year.
F	00:15:21.908	00:15:23.781	it's a lot of fun.
A	00:15:24.457	00:15:25.598	I want to see that.
F	00:15:25.838	00:15:28.821	maybe you can another time.
F	00:15:29.561	00:15:31.841	you don't have time this year.
A	00:15:32.291	00:15:35.593	then I'll come back so I can see the festival!
F	00:15:35.939	00:15:37.180	good!

A	00:15:39.413	00:15:40.480	what's that building?
A	00:15:40.640	00:15:42.582	the architecture is wonderful!
F	00:15:42.910	00:15:47.233	we'll see the presentation about the taroko tribe is there.
F	00:15:47.589	00:15:51.504	then we'll look at the exhibits in another building.
A	00:15:51.941	00:15:53.146	I'd like to see them.
F	00:15:53.737	00:15:56.940	we'll also see some of their arts and crafts.
F	00:15:57.312	00:16:00.887	and some taroko women maybe weaving.
I	00:16:01.553	00:16:05.203	and later, we can see some taroko dances.
A	00:16:05.472	00:16:06.714	I can't wait!

C	00:16:22.231	00:16:24.219	that was a good presentation.
C	00:16:24.597	00:16:25.945	I learned a lot.
A	00:16:26.206	00:16:27.154	me too.
A	00:16:27.600	00:16:29.731	I didn't know about their tattoos.
F	00:16:30.017	00:16:35.895	when I first came to Holly and years ago, I saw those tattoos a lot.
F	00:16:36.269	00:16:39.372	now I rarely see them.
I	00:16:40.052	00:16:43.377	only very old people have them now.
A	00:16:44.172	00:16:45.970	is someone taking pictures of them?
A	00:16:46.451	00:16:48.769	they need to preserve that part of their culture!
I	00:16:48.990	00:16:49.535	I know.
I	00:16:49.928	00:16:52.034	some people are doing that.

F	00:17:03.721	00:17:07.555	the taroko women are very good at weaving.
F	00:17:08.056	00:17:10.342	they use lots of colors now.
F	00:17:10.917	00:17:16.119	but they used to use only white with some red and green.
A	00:17:16.687	00:17:18.823	weeding must take a lot of time.
F	00:17:19.171	00:17:20.453	it does!
A	00:17:21.865	00:17:23.748	let's go back to the gift shop now.
A	00:17:24.018	00:17:25.907	I want to buy something from my mother.
I	00:17:27.557	00:17:28.315	sure!
I	00:17:28.679	00:17:30.148	but don't stop too long.
I	00:17:30.574	00:17:32.069	we still have more to see.

A	00:17:44.905	00:17:46.615	can we see the dances now?
F	00:17:46.794	00:17:47.932	not now.
F	00:17:48.232	00:17:50.459	we'll see them after dinner.
F	00:17:50.966	00:17:55.219	we can eat barbecued pork and bamboo rice.
A	00:17:55.652	00:17:56.804	sounds interesting.
A	00:17:57.199	00:17:58.331	I want to try them.
A	00:17:59.009	00:18:02.269	but we still have a couple of hours before dinner.
I	00:18:03.166	00:18:06.091	let's go walk in the bamboo forest.
I	00:18:06.845	00:18:08.982	it's above the visitors centre.
F	00:18:09.602	00:18:13.396	we can see lots of plants and birds there.
A	00:18:13.684	00:18:14.631	let's go!
