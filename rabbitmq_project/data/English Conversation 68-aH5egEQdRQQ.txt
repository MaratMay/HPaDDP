B	00:01:02.719	00:01:07.520	a cup of tea and my chocolate cake.
B	00:01:07.520	00:01:10.390	will keep your mind off the musical.

A	00:01:41.840	00:01:47.840	i'm sorry anne... listen, how do you think the musical will go?
B	00:01:47.840	00:01:50.960	i think it will go very well!
B	00:01:50.960	00:01:54.640	greece is considered a classic musical!
B	00:01:54.640	00:01:58.880	it's successful, entertaining...
B	00:01:58.880	00:02:01.590	there will be loads of people clapping.
A	00:02:01.600	00:02:03.680	do you really think so?
B	00:02:03.680	00:02:05.510	sure i do!
B	00:02:05.520	00:02:10.150	hey, peter. what time does the show start?
A	00:02:10.160	00:02:12.879	at nine o'clock.
A	00:02:12.879	00:02:16.229	how are we going get to the theater?
B	00:02:16.239	00:02:17.840	i'm going to drive.
A	00:02:17.840	00:02:21.270	i don't think that's a very good idea.
B	00:02:21.280	00:02:22.480	why not?
A	00:02:22.480	00:02:26.879	because parking there is almost impossible.
B	00:02:26.879	00:02:31.200	okay, we'll take the tube.
A	00:02:31.200	00:02:34.959	that's a much better idea.
A	00:02:34.959	00:02:37.360	when shall we leave?
B	00:02:37.360	00:02:38.790	around eight thirty?
A	00:02:38.800	00:02:41.830	no, that's too late!
B	00:02:41.840	00:02:46.710	okay! we'll leave earlier!
A	00:02:46.720	00:02:48.777	oh i'm so sorry anne.
B	00:02:49.722	00:02:50.495	Peter.

B	00:02:57.680	00:03:03.030	i think you need to relax a bit!
B	00:03:03.040	00:03:07.910	why don't you go and take a nap?
A	00:03:07.920	00:03:09.680	i can't sleep...
A	00:03:09.680	00:03:11.430	i'm too nervous!
B	00:03:11.440	00:03:12.959	okay.
B	00:03:12.959	00:03:16.400	why don't you rehearse your part again?
A	00:03:16.400	00:03:17.360	i can't...
A	00:03:17.360	00:03:19.270	i can't remember anything!
B	00:03:19.280	00:03:20.080	okay.

C	00:03:36.959	00:03:38.550	is there anything to eat?
A	00:03:38.560	00:03:42.070	how can you think about food at a time like this?
C	00:03:42.080	00:03:42.720	why?
C	00:03:42.720	00:03:43.760	what's the matter?
A	00:03:43.760	00:03:46.470	what's the matter?

C	00:03:55.040	00:03:56.319	don't worry!
A	00:03:56.319	00:04:00.400	why does everyone tell me the same stupid things?!
C	00:04:00.400	00:04:04.470	because it's the truth!
C	00:04:04.480	00:04:08.789	look peter, take this lucky charm!
C	00:04:08.799	00:04:12.239	i bought it in portobello market this morning.
C	00:04:12.239	00:04:16.069	i'll give it to you as a lucky mascot!
C	00:04:16.079	00:04:24.070	remember, you have to kiss it three times...
C	00:04:24.080	00:04:28.550	and then keep it in the right pocket of your jacket.
A	00:04:28.560	00:04:31.590	why just in the right pocket?
C	00:04:31.600	00:04:34.400	well, i don't know...
C	00:04:34.400	00:04:39.590	the woman who gave it to me said that this is what you have to do.
C	00:04:39.600	00:04:43.720	anyway i'm sure it will bring you luck!
A	00:04:45.120	00:04:48.390	Hmm! not so sure...
C	00:04:48.400	00:04:50.479	why not?
C	00:04:50.479	00:04:52.469	shall we bet on it?
A	00:04:52.479	00:04:53.759	all right!
A	00:04:53.759	00:04:55.360	sounds like fun!
A	00:04:55.360	00:04:56.710	how much?
C	00:04:56.720	00:05:00.790	oh, let's make it interesting.
C	00:05:00.800	00:05:06.560	if it brings you luck, you'll take me for dinner at bluebird.
A	00:05:06.560	00:05:07.440	bluebird?
A	00:05:07.440	00:05:08.870	are you crazy?
A	00:05:08.880	00:05:11.520	that's london's most expensive restaurant.
C	00:05:11.520	00:05:13.840	i know, i know...
C	00:05:13.840	00:05:18.880	but the musical is important to you, peter, isn't it?
A	00:05:18.880	00:05:21.350	well all right alice!
A	00:05:21.360	00:05:26.479	what will you do if it doesn't bring me luck?
C	00:05:26.479	00:05:32.070	well, i will cook dinner for a month!
A	00:05:32.080	00:05:34.160	but you can't cook!
C	00:05:34.160	00:05:35.990	aha, peter!
C	00:05:36.000	00:05:38.320	that's why i said it!
C	00:05:38.320	00:05:43.590	this way i'm sure you will make it bring you luck!

A	00:05:43.600	00:05:47.919	well guys, why don't we go to the cinema tonight?
B	00:05:47.919	00:05:49.919	that's a great idea.
B	00:05:49.919	00:05:50.639	what's on?
A	00:05:50.639	00:05:54.629	well, there's the new film with schwarzenegger.
A	00:05:54.639	00:05:56.080	that should be good.
D	00:05:56.080	00:05:58.070	you're joking, right?
A	00:05:58.080	00:06:00.240	no i'm not.
A	00:06:00.240	00:06:01.990	what would you suggest?
D	00:06:02.000	00:06:04.800	how about going to the disco?
A	00:06:04.800	00:06:06.390	the disco?
A	00:06:06.400	00:06:07.840	are you crazy, alice?
A	00:06:07.840	00:06:09.840	that's not even music...
A	00:06:09.840	00:06:11.440	that's simply noise!
D	00:06:11.440	00:06:12.639	come on, peter!
D	00:06:12.639	00:06:14.230	it's saturday night.
D	00:06:14.240	00:06:17.270	we have to do something special...
D	00:06:17.280	00:06:19.759	something exciting!
D	00:06:19.759	00:06:24.080	and going dancing is surely more exciting than going to the cinema!
E	00:06:24.080	00:06:26.720	i agree with alice!
E	00:06:26.720	00:06:31.270	let's go dancing!
B	00:06:31.280	00:06:34.000	what about a third choice?
A	00:06:34.000	00:06:36.710	i guess anne is right!
A	00:06:36.720	00:06:40.080	why don't we try to find a good compromise?
D	00:06:40.080	00:06:41.759	come on, guys how!
D	00:06:41.759	00:06:44.629	boring and old-fashioned you are!
A	00:06:44.639	00:06:47.520	and you are more frivolous than i am alice.
E	00:06:47.520	00:06:48.880	come on guys!
E	00:06:48.880	00:06:52.309	don't argue now, please!
E	00:06:52.319	00:06:54.240	let's vote on it!
E	00:06:54.240	00:06:57.430	well alice and i want to go dancing.
E	00:06:57.440	00:07:00.950	peter and anne don't...
E	00:07:00.960	00:07:03.280	how about you, sharon?
B	00:07:03.280	00:07:06.870	i don't know...
B	00:07:06.880	00:07:10.710	well...
B	00:07:10.720	00:07:15.189	the disco is probably more entertaining than the cinema...
D	00:07:15.199	00:07:16.880	great!
D	00:07:16.880	00:07:18.390	okay, guys.
D	00:07:18.400	00:07:20.400	three against two...
D	00:07:20.400	00:07:26.390	let's go dancing!

C	00:07:26.400	00:07:29.670	here's my party hat!
C	00:07:29.680	00:07:31.039	how do you like it?

B	00:07:33.599	00:07:35.759	i envy you!
B	00:07:35.759	00:07:37.830	hats really suit you!
C	00:07:37.840	00:07:40.160	well i envy your room, anne.
C	00:07:40.160	00:07:42.960	but with all this traffic how do you sleep?
B	00:07:42.960	00:07:44.800	oh i'm used to it!
D	00:07:44.800	00:07:46.950	which disco are we going to?
C	00:07:46.960	00:07:48.160	paradise.
C	00:07:48.160	00:07:50.469	it's a new disco on kings road...
C	00:07:50.479	00:07:52.400	it's very nice!
B	00:07:52.400	00:07:54.800	did tom and you go there together?
C	00:07:54.800	00:07:55.199	yes.
C	00:07:55.199	00:07:57.680	we went last Saturday...
C	00:07:57.680	00:08:01.110	we spent a nice night together...
B	00:08:01.120	00:08:04.390	maybe i asked the wrong question.
B	00:08:04.400	00:08:06.639	you don't like tom, do you?
C	00:08:06.639	00:08:10.400	he's boring, very boring...
C	00:08:10.400	00:08:13.199	besides. he's an aries!
C	00:08:13.199	00:08:15.830	and he talks too much...
D	00:08:15.840	00:08:16.639	last night.
D	00:08:16.639	00:08:17.840	for example,
C	00:08:17.840	00:08:22.000	he showed me all the pictures of his holiday in the alps.
C	00:08:22.000	00:08:25.280	he talked for an hour about the mountains...
C	00:08:25.280	00:08:27.120	but i hate the mountains!
D	00:08:27.120	00:08:28.319	why'd you say that?
D	00:08:28.319	00:08:32.159	the mountains are beautiful and spectacular.
C	00:08:32.159	00:08:34.240	i prefer the beach...
C	00:08:34.240	00:08:37.919	it's more relaxing and entertaining!
D	00:08:37.919	00:08:38.159	oh.
D	00:08:38.159	00:08:39.509	i don't know.
D	00:08:39.519	00:08:42.320	i think the beach is more boring than the mountains.
B	00:08:42.320	00:08:44.230	why do you say that?
D	00:08:44.240	00:08:46.480	well think about it.
D	00:08:46.480	00:08:49.030	lying on the beach every day.
D	00:08:49.040	00:08:52.829	it's much more interesting to be walking in the countryside.
B	00:08:52.839	00:08:58.560	yes, but it's usually colder in the mountains.
B	00:08:58.560	00:09:02.630	i think the beach is also more romantic.
C	00:09:02.640	00:09:06.470	girls stop talking nonsense!
C	00:09:06.480	00:09:08.160	how do i look?
D	00:09:08.160	00:09:10.949	you look very pretty, alice!
C	00:09:10.959	00:09:11.839	thanks sharon.
C	00:09:11.839	00:09:14.399	but you look better than me.
D	00:09:14.399	00:09:16.880	no, how can you say that?
D	00:09:16.880	00:09:18.800	you're much more tan than i am.
C	00:09:18.800	00:09:21.920	yes but you are in better shape.
B	00:09:21.920	00:09:25.829	and me?
B	00:09:25.839	00:09:28.480	how do i look?
D	00:09:28.480	00:09:29.910	you are very pretty too.
D	00:09:29.920	00:09:31.600	anne.
B	00:09:31.600	00:09:35.920	i'm sure i'm not nearly as beautiful as you!
D	00:09:35.920	00:09:37.269	come on guys!
D	00:09:37.279	00:09:41.670	start making stupid comparisons!
D	00:09:41.680	00:09:45.590	let's just say that we're all different...
E	00:09:45.600	00:09:47.040	hey girls!
E	00:09:47.040	00:09:48.320	okay, are you ready?
E	00:09:48.320	00:09:50.240	i need your advice...
E	00:09:50.240	00:09:53.350	which shirt is better according to you?
C	00:09:53.360	00:09:58.790	the red one it's much better than the blue one for a disco night.
E	00:09:58.800	00:10:00.880	and you, sharon?
E	00:10:00.880	00:10:02.710	what do you think?
D	00:10:02.720	00:10:09.269	well, i think the red one is funnier, while the blue one is more professional...
D	00:10:09.279	00:10:11.920	i prefer the blue one.
E	00:10:11.920	00:10:15.990	so girls, which shirt should i put on?

E	00:10:53.760	00:10:55.440	which match?
E	00:10:55.440	00:10:57.910	Ajax vs Juventus.
A	00:10:57.920	00:11:00.320	those teams are boring...
E	00:11:00.320	00:11:01.910	excuse me.
E	00:11:01.920	00:11:04.240	uh excuse me.
E	00:11:04.240	00:11:08.630	Ajax is the best football club in the world!
A	00:11:08.640	00:11:13.209	i'm afraid i don't have a clue.
E	00:11:13.420	00:11:20.870	I know that only music matters...
E	00:11:20.880	00:11:22.160	anyway...

A	00:11:29.440	00:11:32.790	i heard arsenal is the best one of all time.
A	00:11:32.800	00:11:38.800	they've got the most aggressive players, the most important coach, the toughest goalkeeper.
E	00:11:38.800	00:11:42.240	peter, peter...
E	00:11:42.240	00:11:45.430	you are so mistaken!

E	00:11:49.519	00:11:53.120	well, first of all, their defense is superb.
E	00:11:53.120	00:11:56.560	it's much more intelligent than arsenal's.
E	00:11:56.560	00:11:58.079	no still...
