B	00:03:46.952	00:03:49.364	it'll take quite a long time to get there.

D	00:05:57.893	00:05:59.033	don't you get bored at all?
E	00:06:00.220	00:06:07.353	oh! there's always someone new to talk to and always some questions that haven't been asked before.
D	00:06:07.860	00:06:09.979	it's nice when someone enjoys their work.
E	00:06:10.439	00:06:16.007	yes. I love meeting new people and I enjoy practicing my English, too.

D	00:06:18.633	00:06:20.988	and certainly a lot better than my Thai.
E	00:06:21.506	00:06:22.300	thank you.
E	00:06:22.416	00:06:23.665	you're very kind!

A	00:06:32.342	00:06:35.935	please tell me about the most popular resort areas in Thailand.
B	00:06:36.355	00:06:39.268	Thailand has many inland and coastal resorts.
A	00:06:40.236	00:06:43.708	I already know about many of the resorts in southern Thailand.
A	00:06:44.231	00:06:45.872	what about the rest of the country?
B	00:06:47.041	00:06:53.645	Thailand has beautiful rivers and waterfalls and there are mountains and lush forests in the north.
A	00:06:55.096	00:06:58.108	the Thai scenery certainly does sound fantastic.
B	00:06:58.424	00:07:00.745	would you like me to book anything for you now?
A	00:07:01.522	00:07:05.293	wow,there is so much to do and so little time to do it.
A	00:07:05.880	00:07:09.911	I will have to think about how long I have left and then lets you know.
B	00:07:10.297	00:07:11.598	okay. no problem.
B	00:07:11.897	00:07:14.482	I'm here to offer any advice when you need it.
A	00:07:15.582	00:07:16.797	thank you ever so much!
A	00:07:17.160	00:07:17.603	good bye!
B	00:07:17.782	00:07:18.363	good bye!
F	00:07:21.754	00:07:22.353	hello.
F	00:07:24.127	00:07:25.693	I'd like some advice, please.
B	00:07:25.773	00:07:27.276	sure.how can I help you?
F	00:07:28.146	00:07:31.646	I'm on vacation but I'm only here for a few days.
F	00:07:32.257	00:07:34.514	I'd like to know what tours do you recommend.
B	00:07:35.043	00:07:35.613	okay.
B	00:07:36.120	00:07:42.810	are you looking for a day excursion to some local attractions an overnight trip or perhaps a weekend getaway?
F	00:07:44.826	00:07:50.531	I'd like to stay fairly local I think because I've already done a lot of traveling.
B	00:07:51.309	00:07:58.892	in that case, may I suggest that you look through this brochure and see if there's anything there that interests you.
F	00:07:59.485	00:07:59.963	thank you.
F	00:08:02.830	00:08:05.404	Kanchanaburi looks interesting!
F	00:08:06.342	00:08:10.971	I see that you have two package tours to Kanchanaburi.
F	00:08:11.530	00:08:13.326	can you give me the price of each one?
B	00:08:13.476	00:08:22.360	certainly, the day trip costs one thousand three hundred baht and the overnight trip costs two thousand four hundred baht.
F	00:08:25.222	00:08:32.638	it looks like there's a lot more items included on the two-day itinerary so I think I'll choose that one.
B	00:08:32.712	00:08:35.292	okay. I will make the reservation for you.
B	00:08:35.937	00:08:38.683	it's a really good tour so I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
F	00:08:39.403	00:08:39.915	thank you.
F	00:08:41.827	00:08:46.859	besides the bangkok attractions can you tell me what other day trips are available?
B	00:08:47.032	00:08:52.150	certainly the two most popular excursions are tour ayutthaya and Kanchanaburi.
F	00:08:58.357	00:09:02.750	ah, yes. that's where the famous bridge over the river kwai is, isn't it?
B	00:09:02.986	00:09:03.764	that's right.
B	00:09:04.483	00:09:14.991	we offer trips to the bridge and also the death railway where thousands of Allied troops were killed by the brutal treatment of the Japanese during its construction.
F	00:09:15.573	00:09:18.147	what else is there to see in Kanchanaburi?
B	00:09:18.613	00:09:25.395	most in the province remains specially populated and wild so there are a number of wildlife sanctuaries.
F	00:09:26.564	00:09:29.996	I'd like to go see what the real Thai countryside looks like.
B	00:09:30.157	00:09:31.165	yes, you should.
B	00:09:31.579	00:09:33.502	the landscape is so picturesque.
B	00:09:33.854	00:09:38.650	kanchanaburi has several of Thailand's largest waterfalls,they are beautiful!
F	00:09:39.882	00:09:42.611	okay,I'm sold,when can I go?

D	00:09:53.839	00:09:59.084	this is my first trip to Thailand and I'd like to find out some information about Thai customs.
E	00:09:59.568	00:10:03.540	ok. the first thing you should know is the Thai greeting.
D	00:10:04.214	00:10:09.148	yes.I've seen that when Thais greet each other they put their hands together in a prayer position.
E	00:10:09.523	00:10:10.524	that's right.
E	00:10:10.795	00:10:15.430	it's called the Y and Thai people do it to show respect for each other.
D	00:10:15.712	00:10:18.401	that's interesting,we just shake hands.
E	00:10:18.902	00:10:30.279	yes, and most Thai people know that so no one will be angry with you if you don't wai,however, if someone does wai to you then it's only polite to return the greeting.
D	00:10:30.751	00:10:32.789	is that the only time of wai is performed?
E	00:10:33.561	00:10:39.532	no. Thai people also show respect to images of the king and Lord Buddha in the same way.
E	00:10:39.992	00:10:46.677	although when the wai is performed on these occasions the hands are held higher and the head is bowed lower.
E	00:10:47.195	00:10:52.924	the gesture can mean not only hello but also thank you, goodbye and I'm sorry.
D	00:10:53.201	00:10:56.603	wow, I didn't know that thanks for your advice.

G	00:10:59.540	00:11:02.044	I heard that Thai food is very delicious.
G	00:11:02.470	00:11:03.944	is it very spicy?
E	00:11:04.434	00:11:10.405	Thai food is wonderful but a lot of our dishes are made using chilies.
E	00:11:10.785	00:11:15.034	so be careful especially if you're not used to hot food.
G	00:11:15.944	00:11:19.365	is it possible to eat food that isn't very spicy?
E	00:11:19.991	00:11:23.705	yes. there are a number of dishes that aren't too spicy.
E	00:11:24.142	00:11:29.791	look out for dishes that are made using coconut milk,those tend to be less spicy.
G	00:11:30.580	00:11:33.055	is there any Thai food I should watch out for?
E	00:11:35.859	00:11:42.947	my advice is to try everything but do be careful if you buy food from a street vendor.
E	00:11:43.517	00:11:46.287	they are not governed by the Health Authority.
E	00:11:46.615	00:11:51.964	so the food might not be as clean or well prepared as the food you would get in a restaurant.
G	00:11:52.862	00:11:55.395	thank you,you've been very helpful!
E	00:11:56.011	00:11:57.025	no problem.

H	00:12:03.617	00:12:07.245	what do traditional Thai homes look like?
E	00:12:07.959	00:12:15.196	well, traditional homes were made from teak,they had ornate roofs and were usually built on stilts.
E	00:12:15.680	00:12:19.923	nowadays most people live in modern houses or apartments.
H	00:12:21.766	00:12:25.082	what should I do if I'm invited to a Thai house?
E	00:12:25.612	00:12:31.680	Thai people are very hospitable so it's not unusual to be invited into someone's home.
H	00:12:32.872	00:12:35.158	are there any do's and don'ts?
E	00:12:36.505	00:12:40.887	well, you must remember to take your shoes off at the door.
E	00:12:41.371	00:12:43.265	that's the most important thing.
H	00:12:45.292	00:12:46.910	what should I expect?
E	00:12:48.096	00:12:52.258	oh! you probably be offered something to eat and drink.
E	00:12:52.679	00:12:58.275	a glass of water,a cup of coffee, some fruit, whatever is at hand really.
H	00:12:59.542	00:13:02.018	but what if I'm not hungry or thirsty?
E	00:13:03.152	00:13:04.776	you should try something.
E	00:13:05.190	00:13:09.123	to refuse even a taste might be considered impolite.
H	00:13:11.121	00:13:13.694	thank you that's good advice to know.
E	00:13:14.097	00:13:14.950	you're welcome.

E	00:15:14.300	00:15:17.650	you can usually knock them down a lot though.

G	00:17:47.620	00:17:52.010	I've seen miniature temples next to people's houses.
G	00:17:52.010	00:17:53.000	what are they for?
E	00:17:53.000	00:17:56.470	ah there's spirit houses.
