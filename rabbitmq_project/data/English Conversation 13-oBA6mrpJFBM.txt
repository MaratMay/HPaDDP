C	00:10:02.610	00:10:05.940	could I ask you about the prices for these shoes?
B	00:10:05.950	00:10:08.520	yes, which shoes are you interested in?
C	00:10:08.530	00:10:12.300	I'm interested in these  two pairs of shoes.
B	00:10:12.767	00:10:20.816	the first pair is  sixty five dollars and the second pair which just arrived yesterday is  eighty five dollars.
C	00:10:21.990	00:10:24.240	they're quite expensive.
C	00:10:24.240	00:10:26.250	could you give me a discount?
B	00:10:26.250	00:10:28.120	I'm sorry, sir.
B	00:10:28.120	00:10:31.510	the prices are fixed throughout this store.
C	00:10:32.520	00:10:37.770	could you give me a discount if I bought both pairs of shoes?
B	00:10:38.317	00:10:39.788	I'm really sorry, sir.
B	00:10:39.833	00:10:42.500	but there is no bargaining in this store.
C	00:10:44.610	00:10:45.610	ok.
C	00:10:45.610	00:10:50.220	a discount really would have helped me to buy both pairs of shoes.
B	00:10:50.570	00:10:53.678	sir, if you need shoes with lower prices.
B	00:10:53.693	00:10:55.135	I could show you some.
C	00:10:56.238	00:10:57.147	no, that's ok.
C	00:10:58.020	00:10:59.920	I'll take this pair.
B	00:10:59.920	00:11:01.270	all right then.
B	00:11:01.270	00:11:04.580	that will be  eighty five dollars.

H	00:11:06.547	00:11:07.185	good morning.
H	00:11:07.208	00:11:07.928	how are you?
I	00:11:08.416	00:11:09.152	I'm very well.
I	00:11:09.182	00:11:09.911	thank you.
H	00:11:10.040	00:11:13.540	I would like to direct your attention to the televisions.
I	00:11:13.540	00:11:15.640	they are very nice.
I	00:11:15.640	00:11:18.900	the overall design is very modern and sleek.
I	00:11:18.910	00:11:20.540	how much are they?
H	00:11:20.540	00:11:29.680	well, the  fourteen inch, the  twenty inch and the  twenty-one inch are  one hundred and ten,  one hundred and eighty and  two hundred and ten respectively.
I	00:11:29.680	00:11:30.850	hmm.
I	00:11:31.098	00:11:33.433	I really like the  twenty-one inch.
I	00:11:34.780	00:11:36.650	do you give discount?
H	00:11:36.650	00:11:45.920	the TV's are already on sale, these prices are sales prices,  twenty percent off the regular price.
I	00:11:45.920	00:11:47.560	oh!
I	00:11:47.560	00:11:51.700	but I was expecting bigger discounts.
H	00:11:51.700	00:11:53.170	I'm sorry.
H	00:11:53.170	00:12:01.170	and I should mention to you that this is a special promotion sale for a limited time only.
I	00:12:01.235	00:12:02.196	hmm!
I	00:12:03.100	00:12:06.850	maybe I should wait for a clearance sale.
H	00:12:06.850	00:12:15.050	you could do that but the model you want we no longer be in stock.
I	00:12:23.459	00:12:24.623	ok.
I	00:12:24.660	00:12:28.752	it's a little bit expensive but I'll go for the  twenty-one inch.

H	00:12:32.590	00:12:33.370	hello.
H	00:12:33.595	00:12:34.579	how may I help you?
J	00:12:34.714	00:12:40.014	I have come to buy the new Sony stereo which was advertised in the newspaper last week.
H	00:12:40.300	00:12:42.600	ah, that's just right over here.
J	00:12:45.600	00:12:50.520	the price for the new model was advertised at a  one hundred and seventy nine dollars.
J	00:12:50.520	00:12:55.110	but the price on the price tag shows  one hundred and ninety nine dollars.
H	00:12:55.110	00:12:56.110	yes.
H	00:12:56.110	00:13:00.250	the  one hundred and seventy nine dollars was for the weekend sale.
H	00:13:00.250	00:13:02.640	the weekend's over now.
J	00:13:02.640	00:13:07.320	but I came in expecting it to be  one hundred and seventy nine dollars.
H	00:13:07.320	00:13:11.890	I'm sorry, ma'am but as you've missed the weekend sales period.
H	00:13:11.890	00:13:15.660	I'm afraid I cannot offer you the weekend sales price.
J	00:13:15.660	00:13:18.120	let me talk to the manager.
H	00:13:18.208	00:13:18.846	okay.
H	00:13:18.883	00:13:19.754	one moment, please.
H	00:13:21.600	00:13:22.870	hello, Simon?.
H	00:13:22.133	00:13:23.388	yes.
H	00:13:23.411	00:13:25.325	can you help me with some customer service, please?
H	00:13:25.363	00:13:26.264	over at Sony.
H	00:13:26.350	00:13:27.370	thank you.
H	00:13:27.370	00:13:32.240	one moment, please.
K	00:13:32.250	00:13:33.580	good afternoon.
K	00:13:33.629	00:13:35.123	how can I be of service to you?
J	00:13:35.386	00:13:41.963	I came in expecting to buy the new Sony model for the advertised price of  one hundred and seventy nine dollars.
J	00:13:41.850	00:13:45.850	but your salesperson tells me I have missed the sale period.
K	00:13:45.850	00:13:46.570	see.
K	00:13:46.570	00:13:50.800	it is correct that the sale price was only for the weekend.
K	00:13:50.800	00:13:56.750	however, if you purchase the stereo for the regular price of  one hundred and ninety nine dollars.
K	00:13:56.760	00:14:02.160	what I could do is give you discount coupons for your next purchase at our store.
J	00:14:02.160	00:14:03.840	ok, thank you.
J	00:14:03.826	00:14:06.942	then I will take the stereo and the discount coupons.
K	00:14:06.942	00:14:07.528	great.

C	00:14:17.419	00:14:18.679	hi!
H	00:14:18.679	00:14:20.159	hi, can I help you?
C	00:14:20.269	00:14:20.659	oh, yes.
C	00:14:20.682	00:14:25.510	I'd like to buy a new GSM phone with internet capabilities.
H	00:14:25.909	00:14:26.969	hmm.
H	00:14:26.969	00:14:32.640	I think this Panasonic would be the best phone for you.
C	00:14:32.552	00:14:33.776	ok.
C	00:14:34.640	00:14:36.150	how much is it?
H	00:14:36.150	00:14:39.279	it's only  three hundred and seventy five dollars.
C	00:14:39.289	00:14:40.289	wow!
C	00:14:40.440	00:14:42.500	that's too expensive.
C	00:14:42.510	00:14:47.870	the last Panasonic model that I bought was only  two hundred and fifty dollars.
H	00:14:48.146	00:14:48.582	yes.
H	00:14:48.604	00:14:53.049	well, the internet capability has pushed up the cost of phone.
H	00:14:53.099	00:14:58.029	really,  three hundred and seventy five dollars is not that expensive.
C	00:14:58.039	00:15:03.320	well, could you lower the price to  three hundred?
H	00:15:03.320	00:15:04.700	no.
H	00:15:04.700	00:15:11.659	the best I can do for you is  three hundred and forty.
C	00:15:11.659	00:15:12.659	ok.
C	00:15:12.659	00:15:16.070	I'll take this new Panasonic model.

L	00:15:16.070	00:15:17.360	good morning.
L	00:15:17.370	00:15:18.030	how are you?
H	00:15:18.030	00:15:19.200	I'm fine.
H	00:15:19.200	00:15:20.060	how is business?
L	00:15:20.070	00:15:21.780	business is going good.
L	00:15:21.780	00:15:24.049	how is your business doing?
H	00:15:24.297	00:15:26.978	our business is not so good.
H	00:15:28.126	00:15:30.499	everybody in the market is reducing their prices.
L	00:15:30.690	00:15:31.560	hmm.
L	00:15:31.560	00:15:34.580	have you lowered your retail prices?
H	00:15:34.580	00:15:35.969	not yet.
H	00:15:35.969	00:15:40.979	but when we do we would like to ask for you to reduce your prices to us.
L	00:15:40.979	00:15:41.880	hmm.
L	00:15:41.880	00:15:45.679	how much of a reduction in price do you need?
H	00:15:45.679	00:15:52.419	well, everybody else is reducing their prices between  ten and  fifteen percent.
L	00:15:52.429	00:15:53.520	hmm.
L	00:15:53.520	00:15:56.419	well as you know, costs are increasing.
L	00:15:56.419	00:16:00.830	it will be very difficult for us to reduce our prices.
H	00:16:00.830	00:16:06.630	well, as you know, if we cannot remain competitive, we will lose our business.
L	00:16:06.630	00:16:07.729	yes.
L	00:16:08.189	00:16:11.162	well, we understand and we want to work with you.
L	00:16:11.000	00:16:15.600	however, we simply cannot cut our prices by ten to  fifteen percent.
H	00:16:18.180	00:16:20.740	what is the best deal that you could offer us?
L	00:16:20.773	00:16:25.345	well, we could reduce your prices by  five percent.
L	00:16:25.368	00:16:31.659	and if you buy more than  fifty units, we can give you an additional five percent discount.
H	00:16:32.880	00:16:34.510	fair enough.
L	00:16:34.510	00:16:35.670	deal!

M	00:16:38.670	00:16:39.670	hello.
M	00:16:39.670	00:16:40.960	how can I help you?
C	00:16:40.960	00:16:44.130	I'm looking to buy a car for my wife.
M	00:16:44.140	00:16:44.920	hmm.
M	00:16:44.920	00:16:47.610	did you have a specific model in mind?
C	00:16:47.610	00:16:48.870	yes.
C	00:16:48.880	00:16:55.090	I'm most interested in the soluna with automatic transmission and full option package.
M	00:16:55.090	00:16:58.520	that's a very popular model at the moment.
M	00:16:58.530	00:17:03.720	the price is  thirteen  thousand  five  hundred dollars.
C	00:17:03.720	00:17:06.220	that seems quite expensive.
C	00:17:06.220	00:17:10.230	is it possible you could give me a discount?
M	00:17:10.686	00:17:14.830	the best we could do is  thirteen thousand two hundred dollars.
M	00:17:15.550	00:17:21.440	additionally, we will also include  three hundred dollars worth of shopping coupons at central department store.
C	00:17:25.440	00:17:29.680	maybe you could throw in a spoiler and other accessories?
C	00:17:29.680	00:17:33.390	or perhaps you could absorb the cost of insurance.
M	00:17:33.390	00:17:35.830	I'll have to check with my manager.
M	00:17:35.830	00:17:38.130	please hold on for a moment.
M	00:17:41.041	00:17:41.777	ok.
M	00:17:41.957	00:17:46.567	in addition to the  three hundred dollars discount and the  three hundred dollars shopping coupons.
M	00:17:46.690	00:17:50.110	we will also include the spoiler and a CD player.
M	00:17:50.110	00:17:53.630	as for the insurance you'll have to pay for that yourself.
C	00:17:54.630	00:17:56.130	ok.
C	00:17:56.130	00:17:57.680	thank you very much.
C	00:17:57.690	00:17:59.500	I'll take the soluna.
M	00:17:59.481	00:18:00.201	oh, great.
M	00:18:00.269	00:18:01.012	come this way.
M	00:18:01.050	00:18:03.430	someone will show you to sign the necessary forms.

I	00:18:19.930	00:18:21.150	excuse me!
I	00:18:21.150	00:18:23.430	could you help me for a moment?
H	00:18:23.440	00:18:24.280	certainly.
H	00:18:24.280	00:18:26.070	what can I do for you?
I	00:18:26.070	00:18:30.540	well, I think there might be some mistakes about phone prices in your store.
H	00:18:30.540	00:18:31.540	really?
H	00:18:31.540	00:18:34.630	can you tell me some more details about this mistake?
I	00:18:34.630	00:18:35.380	yes.
I	00:18:35.380	00:18:41.880	well, the price quoted on a special advertisement for this phone was  twenty-five dollars.
I	00:18:41.880	00:18:45.190	but the tag on the phone says  thirty dollars.
I	00:18:45.190	00:18:46.840	what is the correct price?
H	00:18:47.449	00:18:48.253	I don't know.
H	00:18:48.290	00:18:49.619	but I'm going to check.
H	00:18:49.530	00:18:51.610	one moment, please.
H	00:18:55.320	00:18:57.020	you are right!
H	00:18:57.030	00:19:00.390	this phone should only be  twenty five dollars.
H	00:19:00.390	00:19:03.090	I'm so sorry about the confusion.
H	00:19:03.090	00:19:08.670	I'm going to find out who is responsible for this mistake and have it correct it right away.
I	00:19:08.670	00:19:10.500	thank you.
H	00:19:10.500	00:19:12.640	thank you for helping us.

D	00:19:13.890	00:19:15.220	good afternoon.
E	00:19:15.220	00:19:16.320	good afternoon.
E	00:19:16.320	00:19:17.710	will this be all?
D	00:19:17.710	00:19:19.330	yes, just one pair of pants.
E	00:19:21.198	00:19:23.465	that will be  thirty nine ninety nine.
D	00:19:23.555	00:19:24.622	wait a second.
D	00:19:24.734	00:19:28.601	I thought the sign back there said  twenty nine ninety nine for these pants.
E	00:19:28.630	00:19:29.310	really?
E	00:19:29.310	00:19:32.990	let me try to re-scan the barcode and see.
E	00:19:35.190	00:19:38.670	the computer still shows the price is  thirty nine ninety nine.
E	00:19:38.670	00:19:41.170	let me check with a floor salesperson.
E	00:19:41.087	00:19:42.055	please wait a moment.
D	00:19:42.108	00:19:42.633	thank you.
E	00:19:47.610	00:19:50.580	sir, the price is  thirty nine ninety nine.
E	00:19:50.580	00:19:52.990	you may have misread the prices.
D	00:19:52.990	00:19:53.470	ok.
D	00:19:53.470	00:19:56.170	well, is it possible to cancel this purchase?
D	00:19:56.170	00:19:58.500	I would like to look for another pair of pants.
E	00:19:58.500	00:19:59.810	sure.
D	00:20:00.157	00:20:00.795	thank you.
E	00:20:00.818	00:20:01.490	you're welcome.

E	00:20:05.112	00:20:06.103	may i help you?
G	00:20:06.141	00:20:06.576	yes.
G	00:20:06.599	00:20:09.122	I'm looking for the Ralph Lauren cosmetic set.
E	00:20:09.519	00:20:09.970	oh.
E	00:20:09.970	00:20:10.533	great!
E	00:20:10.563	00:20:11.314	you're in luck.
E	00:20:11.344	00:20:12.876	we still have  three sets left.
G	00:20:12.883	00:20:13.364	oh, great.
G	00:20:13.364	00:20:14.760	I will take one, please.
E	00:20:16.020	00:20:19.350	it comes with a complimentary bag.
G	00:20:19.350	00:20:23.040	how nice! is there more than one color for the bag?
E	00:20:23.040	00:20:27.880	actually, we have two colors: silver and black.
E	00:20:27.880	00:20:29.370	which one would you like?
G	00:20:30.031	00:20:31.713	I'll take the black one, please.
E	00:20:31.713	00:20:32.156	great.
E	00:20:42.480	00:20:45.090	that will be  eighty five dollars.
G	00:20:45.198	00:20:45.926	excuse me!
G	00:20:45.926	00:20:51.715	according to the advertisement in Elle magazine this month, one set cost  sixty five dollars.
E	00:20:51.900	00:20:56.260	yes, the ad quotes  sixty five dollars for the set.
E	00:20:56.260	00:20:59.579	but you must bring the ad in order to receive the discount.
E	00:20:59.579	00:21:04.710	let me check with my manager whether we can still give it to you with a discount.

D	00:32:53.340	00:32:57.710	now looks like an extra small shirt after just one wash!
C	00:32:57.710	00:33:00.090	sir, may I see the shirt?
D	00:33:00.090	00:33:03.990	yes, you may see the extra small shirt.
C	00:33:03.990	00:33:06.380	oh.
C	00:33:06.380	00:33:09.180	it's amazing how much is it shrunk?
D	00:33:09.180	00:33:10.260	yes, it is.
D	00:33:10.260	00:33:14.090	it is now the right size for my young son.
C	00:33:14.090	00:33:18.840	sir, did you read the washing directions before you did your laundry?
D	00:33:18.840	00:33:19.740	no.
D	00:33:19.740	00:33:23.630	I just washed it in hot water with all the rest of my clothes.
C	00:33:23.630	00:33:30.320	sir, the washing directions clearly indicate that you do not wash it in hot water.
D	00:33:30.320	00:33:31.700	really?
C	00:33:31.700	00:33:33.930	yes, I'm sorry.
C	00:33:33.930	00:33:36.300	I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to help you.
D	00:33:36.300	00:33:41.780	well, then I guess my son has got a new shirt.

E	00:33:41.112	00:33:44.267	has anyone waited on you yet, ma'm?
G	00:33:44.267	00:33:44.868	not yet.
E	00:33:45.090	00:33:46.980	what can I help you with?
G	00:33:46.980	00:33:51.030	I purchased this shirt for my husband last week and I'd like to return it.
E	00:33:51.030	00:33:53.510	what is the problem with the shirt?
G	00:33:53.520	00:33:56.640	well, I washed it once and the colour has faded.
E	00:33:56.640	00:34:00.780	oh, did you follow the washing instructions on the shirt tag?
G	00:34:00.747	00:34:01.408	of course.
G	00:34:01.453	00:34:04.561	I did exactly what the instructions indicate to do.
E	00:34:04.967	00:34:05.635	oh!
E	00:34:05.688	00:34:06.934	do you have a receipt?
G	00:34:06.930	00:34:08.630	yes.
G	00:34:08.630	00:34:10.790	here it is.
G	00:34:10.790	00:34:16.530	I'm not too happy about this because when the colour faded, it ruined some of the other clothing.
E	00:34:16.530	00:34:19.010	I'm very sorry to hear that.
E	00:34:19.020	00:34:21.870	the only thing I can do is refund the price with a shirt.
G	00:34:21.980	00:34:23.332	at least you can do that.
G	00:34:23.429	00:34:24.255	thank you.
E	00:34:24.299	00:34:25.470	all right.
E	00:34:25.470	00:34:29.750	could you please fill out the return form?
