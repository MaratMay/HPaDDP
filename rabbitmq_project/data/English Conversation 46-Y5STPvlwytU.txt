G	00:05:29.990	00:05:32.293	it only took thirty minutes.
G	00:05:32.293	00:05:35.952	when I drive is sometimes takes longer than that.
D	00:05:35.952	00:05:39.604	so will you ride the bus all the time now.

B	00:06:17.089	00:06:19.779	my mom and I weren't always close.
B	00:06:19.779	00:06:22.717	I'm sad we didn't become friends sooner.
H	00:06:22.717	00:06:24.889	but you're close now.
B	00:06:24.889	00:06:26.177	oh yes.
H	00:06:28.260	00:06:33.654	maybe one day amber will think of me as a good friend.
B	00:06:33.654	00:06:37.480	maybe she already does.

F	00:06:37.490	00:06:41.664	amber thanks for watching the store after school today.

H	00:07:12.656	00:07:13.908	what are you doing?
E	00:07:13.908	00:07:17.060	I was just wondering if you'd like to get some coffee.
H	00:07:17.060	00:07:22.240	sure.
E	00:07:22.240	00:07:24.604	mom you're so funny.

H	00:07:37.059	00:07:40.613	it's so nice to hear you say that.
E	00:07:40.613	00:07:42.552	I like spending time with you.
E	00:07:42.552	00:07:46.850	it's too bad we didn't spend more time together before now.
H	00:07:46.850	00:07:50.979	I feel the same way.
H	00:07:50.979	00:07:54.639	so how was school today.
E	00:07:54.639	00:07:55.870	okay.
E	00:07:55.880	00:07:57.261	I saw Ryan.
E	00:07:57.261	00:07:59.722	he asked me to go see a movie with him.
H	00:07:59.722	00:08:01.180	what did you say.
E	00:08:01.180	00:08:05.500	well I remembered what Mia told me.
E	00:08:05.500	00:08:10.659	but we need to be wise about what we try.
E	00:08:10.659	00:08:13.405	I've tried being friends with Ryan.
E	00:08:13.405	00:08:15.219	and it's not wise.
E	00:08:15.219	00:08:17.327	so I told him no.
H	00:08:17.327	00:08:22.219	I'm glad you haven't had second thoughts about breaking up with Ryan.
E	00:08:22.219	00:08:26.889	I feel bad about not talking to him much anymore.
E	00:08:26.889	00:08:31.149	but I know that's what is best for me.
H	00:08:31.149	00:08:34.836	have you been able to make some new friends this year.
E	00:08:34.836	00:08:36.159	oh yeah.
E	00:08:36.169	00:08:37.529	there's this girl Judy.
E	00:08:37.529	00:08:38.860	she's so much fun.
H	00:08:38.870	00:08:41.452	I'm glad you're making new friends.
H	00:08:41.452	00:08:45.975	I'm impressed with how much you've changed this year.
E	00:08:45.975	00:08:50.019	well I've done some things I shouldn't.
H	00:08:50.019	00:08:54.019	saying you're sick when you're not isn't wrong.
F	00:08:54.019	00:08:56.138	oh that.
E	00:08:56.138	00:09:00.346	I felt really guilty about that.
H	00:09:00.346	00:09:04.907	but then you did the right thing and learned from your mistake.
E	00:09:04.907	00:09:07.981	and now Liz and I are really good friends.
H	00:09:07.981	00:09:11.606	working at the Stop 'n' Shop has been really good for you.
H	00:09:11.606	00:09:16.491	I regret I didn't do something like that when I was your age.
E	00:09:16.491	00:09:18.005	it's been fun.
E	00:09:18.005	00:09:20.762	the break-in really shook me up though.
H	00:09:20.762	00:09:25.346	I want you to know that I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
E	00:09:25.346	00:09:26.744	I know Mom.
H	00:09:26.744	00:09:33.610	but I was so impressed with how you responded.
F	00:09:33.610	00:09:39.822	well you've all given me a second chance before
F	00:09:39.822	00:09:41.776	I guess it's my turn.
F	00:09:41.776	00:09:44.500	I forgive you.
H	00:09:44.500	00:09:47.272	you're a great daughter amber.
E	00:09:47.272	00:09:50.203	really no regrets huh?
H	00:09:50.203	00:09:53.010	well maybe one.
E	00:09:53.010	00:09:53.945	what.
H	00:09:53.945	00:09:59.110	you're so special I regret we didn't have more children.
E	00:09:59.110	00:10:00.471	yeah.
E	00:10:00.471	00:10:02.410	a brother would have been cool.
