C	00:11:17.000	00:11:18.670	is there a problem, officer?
H	00:11:18.670	00:11:22.700	it's just that our sniffer dog has smelt something in your bag.
H	00:11:22.700	00:11:26.170	I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to open it for me.
C	00:11:26.170	00:11:28.270	yes, of course.
C	00:11:28.270	00:11:30.830	you're welcome to have a look.
H	00:11:35.830	00:11:38.270	this is what our sniffer dog found.
H	00:11:38.270	00:11:42.110	I'm afraid you're carrying a packet of biscuits and the packet is split.
C	00:11:42.110	00:11:45.750	I forgot about those.
C	00:11:45.760	00:11:48.850	they must have been broken during the flight.
H	00:11:48.850	00:11:51.320	well, I can't see anything else.

C	00:25:31.284	00:25:34.560	HI, I wonder if you can help me.
F	00:25:34.560	00:25:36.300	I will certainly try.
F	00:25:36.300	00:25:37.440	what can I do for you?
C	00:25:37.440	00:25:40.980	well, it's my first day here in Sydney.
C	00:25:40.980	00:25:44.820	and I would like some advice on the local tourist spots.
F	00:25:44.820	00:25:47.780	we offer a wide range of Tours.
F	00:25:47.780	00:25:52.640	have a look at these leaflets and see if there's anything you like.
C	00:25:54.650	00:25:57.270	what's the wildlife park like?
F	00:25:57.270	00:25:58.860	oh, it's very good.
F	00:25:58.860	00:26:01.731	if you don't have time to go and see the wildlife.
F	00:26:02.000	00:26:05.480	in its natural habitat, you should try it.
C	00:26:05.480	00:26:07.890	what animals do they have their?
F	00:26:08.196	00:26:09.153	oh, let's see now.
F	00:26:09.169	00:26:14.800	they have kangaroos, koalas, possums, wombats and emus.
F	00:26:14.934	00:26:15.528	there're a lot.
C	00:26:15.720	00:26:18.860	I like wildlife.
C	00:26:18.860	00:26:21.800	so that's one place that I should visit.
C	00:26:21.800	00:26:26.810	the leaflet says that that place is a Koala Sanctuary, too?
F	00:26:26.810	00:26:31.490	yes, the New South Wales has a lot of bush-fires in the summer.
C	00:26:31.490	00:26:36.480	yes, I remember reading about one in the newspaper not very long ago.
F	00:26:36.480	00:26:41.700	yeah, a lot of koalas are made homeless when the forest is burned down.
F	00:26:41.700	00:26:44.390	the sanctuary re-homed them.
C	00:26:44.390	00:26:48.020	well, it's nice to know that the money goes to a good cause.
F	00:26:48.020	00:26:50.610	obviously, it's not just koalas.
F	00:26:50.610	00:26:54.990	a lot of other animals are either killed or injured too in the fire.
C	00:26:54.990	00:27:00.740	okay. this is another place on my list of places to visit.
F	00:27:00.740	00:27:04.610	there's a bus that goes there every morning at nine a.m..
F	00:27:04.610	00:27:07.670	would you like me to book a place for you?
C	00:27:07.670	00:27:10.310	yes, I'll go tomorrow.
C	00:27:10.310	00:27:13.010	will the bus pick me up from the hotel?
F	00:27:13.010	00:27:17.450	yes, just wait at reception and they will call you.
C	00:27:17.450	00:27:21.440	are there many things to see closer to the hotel?
F	00:27:21.440	00:27:24.650	yes. here is a map of the area.
F	00:27:24.650	00:27:27.370	it is yours to keep.
C	00:27:27.380	00:27:29.570	thank you.
C	00:27:29.570	00:27:31.969	I'd like to take a walk around.
C	00:27:32.630	00:27:34.490	where should I start?
F	00:27:34.500	00:27:39.980	well, the hotel is located here right near the boat quay.
F	00:27:39.980	00:27:43.670	right around the corner is the weekend market.

F	00:27:54.990	00:27:57.570	you could take a tour of the complex.
C	00:27:57.570	00:27:59.840	hmm. that sounds good, too.
C	00:27:59.840	00:28:02.370	what shows are on at the moment?
