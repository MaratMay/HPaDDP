C	00:04:43.574	00:04:47.878	no, it's probably being used as a getaway car at this very moment.
C	00:04:48.404	00:04:50.633	and look what happened to the car in that robbery yesterday.
A	00:04:51.055	00:04:52.470	has that guy been caught yet?
A	00:04:52.601	00:04:55.677	it's a bit scary thinking, that there's a criminal out there somewhere.

C	00:04:58.919	00:05:01.497	people like that should be locked up for life.
E	00:05:01.673	00:05:03.123	relax, gary.
E	00:05:03.092	00:05:04.839	it will be found sooner or later.
C	00:05:04.929	00:05:05.769	relax?
C	00:05:05.859	00:05:07.704	you wouldn't say that if it was your car.
A	00:05:08.136	00:05:10.748	why don't you come around to our place after work for a meal?
A	00:05:10.921	00:05:12.468	it'll take your mind off things.
C	00:05:12.485	00:05:13.125	thanks!
C	00:05:13.959	00:05:16.890	but if i get my hands on the people who've taken my car, i'll...
C	00:05:18.512	00:05:22.173	nobody messes with gary fenton and gets away with it.

C	00:05:43.257	00:05:43.780	i'll get this.

A	00:06:29.166	00:06:30.727	Ssshhhh!

E	00:06:41.639	00:06:43.078	i'll do it,give me the keys.
C	00:06:43.487	00:06:45.172	i wouldn't do that if i were you.
C	00:06:45.798	00:06:47.576	it could be the man the police are looking for.
A	00:06:47.621	00:06:48.362	gary!
C	00:06:50.821	00:06:51.929	all right.

C	00:07:22.000	00:07:25.110	nobody messes with gary fenton and gets away with it!
E	00:07:25.590	00:07:26.711	our hero.

E	00:07:41.377	00:07:42.602	have you had a good run?
A	00:07:42.681	00:07:43.595	yes, thanks.
E	00:07:44.180	00:07:45.975	you've been doing a lot of training lately.
A	00:07:46.456	00:07:48.598	yes, i thought i'd enter the london marathon.
E	00:07:48.854	00:07:49.944	wow!
A	00:07:52.290	00:07:54.760	do you know where the pen for phone messages is?
E	00:07:55.099	00:07:56.735	i've been using it to do the crossword.
E	00:07:56.957	00:07:59.752	sorry, i know it shouldn't be moved from the phone.
A	00:08:01.811	00:08:04.029	leave those,i'll see to them in a minute.
E	00:08:08.433	00:08:10.129	and i haven't finished with those yet.
E	00:08:10.772	00:08:13.457	it's sunday morning, rebecca, relax.
A	00:08:14.813	00:08:17.304	ok, i'm going to have a shower.

A	00:08:27.487	00:08:29.511	hello, sean,how are you?
H	00:08:33.469	00:08:35.330	not too bad, i suppose.
A	00:08:36.707	00:08:37.929	jason and kylie.
A	00:08:40.136	00:08:41.575	what have they been doing now?
H	00:08:42.779	00:08:46.502	they've been talking on one of those telephone chat lines you know...
H	00:08:46.914	00:08:49.450	where you can talk to people from all over the country.
H	00:08:51.595	00:08:53.083	we got the phone bill yesterday.
H	00:08:54.304	00:08:56.425	i don't know what we're going to do with those kids.
B	00:08:56.699	00:08:57.989	you could try strangling.

I	00:08:58.671	00:09:02.155	Rebecca, your sister phone just now,she'd like you to call her back.
A	00:09:02.255	00:09:04.622	cindy, she never phones me at work.
A	00:09:05.365	00:09:06.608	i wonder what she wants.
I	00:09:08.407	00:09:13.026	could you let me have a report sometime on the amsterdam conference, tim?
I	00:09:13.929	00:09:17.499	and i particularly like to know whether you made any useful contacts there.
B	00:09:18.115	00:09:18.558	sure.
B	00:09:18.769	00:09:19.177	no problem.
I	00:09:19.309	00:09:21.388	i'd like to know what you're up to as well.
I	00:09:21.824	00:09:23.295	i'm sure you would, julia.

A	00:09:26.453	00:09:32.304	it's very strange,i've been living in that flat for four years and she's only ever visited me once before.
E	00:09:32.394	00:09:33.591	do you know what she wants?
A	00:09:33.951	00:09:34.581	no.
E	00:09:34.895	00:09:36.930	why do people have to be so mysterious?
E	00:09:37.220	00:09:39.369	i don't know why they can't just say what's on their mind.
E	00:09:39.964	00:09:40.843	don't you agree, tim?
B	00:09:41.943	00:09:45.012	yes, yes, definitely.

E	00:10:04.505	00:10:07.373	you've been tidying this flap for the last two hours.
E	00:10:07.778	00:10:09.556	and it was tidy when you started.
E	00:10:09.889	00:10:12.784	and that's the fourth time you've straightened that pen.
E	00:10:15.725	00:10:17.628	what is it with you and your family?
E	00:10:17.954	00:10:20.029	why does everything have to be so perfect?
A	00:10:20.375	00:10:23.790	ever since i can remember, cindy's always been better at everything.
A	00:10:23.866	00:10:25.676	she got better grades at school.
A	00:10:25.783	00:10:28.970	she went to university,i went to the local technical college.
A	00:10:29.184	00:10:31.288	she's got a high-powered job in the city.
A	00:10:31.682	00:10:33.648	i'm just a secretary.
E	00:10:33.824	00:10:35.384	a personal assistant.
E	00:10:36.107	00:10:38.087	but i don't see what that's got to do with being tidy.
A	00:10:38.481	00:10:40.543	i've got to show that i'm better at something.
A	00:10:41.020	00:10:46.632	if i can't be as successful as her i can be neater or more organized or fitter.
E	00:10:47.172	00:10:49.262	is that why you want to do the london marathon?
E	00:10:54.625	00:10:56.396	just relax.
E	00:10:57.469	00:11:00.316	tim and i are going out, so i'll be out of your way soon.
B	00:11:07.115	00:11:11.782	julia, i don't know how to say this but there's something i need to tell you.
B	00:11:13.512	00:11:16.508	i suppose you're wondering why i wanted to go to that conference.
B	00:11:18.079	00:11:18.210	well...
B	00:11:23.440	00:11:28.476	hey, you'll never believe this, julia...but...i'm thinking of going to work in australia.
B	00:11:37.683	00:11:40.164	julia, my love...
B	00:11:42.395	00:11:45.198	julia i don't know whether you'll like this, but...
B	00:11:46.855	00:11:48.727	of course she won't like it, you nerd!
B	00:11:53.391	00:11:54.280	it's no good.
B	00:11:56.114	00:11:58.203	i'll wait till i hear whether i've definitely got the job.

E	00:12:01.777	00:12:02.774	hi, rebecca.
E	00:12:03.601	00:12:04.870	is cindy still here?
A	00:12:04.981	00:12:06.092	no,she's gone.
E	00:12:06.742	00:12:07.576	you're right?
E	00:12:07.808	00:12:10.040	only you haven't cleared the table.
A	00:12:10.742	00:12:12.482	i've had such a strange evening.
E	00:12:12.524	00:12:13.534	what happened?
A	00:12:14.513	00:12:20.360	you know cindy's always been a high-powered businesswoman with a flash car and loads of money and now this mba as well.
E	00:12:20.654	00:12:21.315	yeah.
A	00:12:21.737	00:12:23.972	well, she's met this guy called jimmy.
A	00:12:24.315	00:12:26.633	actually, they've been going out for about two years.
A	00:12:26.789	00:12:29.598	she hasn't told mum and dad because they wouldn't approve.
E	00:12:29.799	00:12:31.086	how romantic!
A	00:12:31.169	00:12:33.058	and now she's given up her job.
E	00:12:33.221	00:12:33.812	what?
A	00:12:34.113	00:12:38.019	yes, it seems she's been living a lie all her life.
A	00:12:38.514	00:12:42.005	she's done all the things she's done just to please mum and dad.
E	00:12:42.431	00:12:43.438	wow.
A	00:12:43.905	00:12:45.500	but you haven't heard the best bit.
A	00:12:46.662	00:12:49.814	she envies me because i've always done what i wanted.
A	00:12:50.478	00:12:53.568	and now she's decided to do what she wants to do, too.

C	00:12:57.796	00:12:58.862	going to africa.
A	00:12:59.201	00:13:02.674	yes, she and jimmy are going to teach in a school for blind children.
C	00:13:03.145	00:13:05.017	she won't make any money doing that.
E	00:13:05.643	00:13:07.515	that's the whole point, gary.
B	00:13:07.698	00:13:10.739	so you've been competing with each other all your lives for no reason.
A	00:13:11.134	00:13:14.199	yes, we couldn't tell each other how we really felt.
A	00:13:14.867	00:13:18.735	you were right the other day, julia,we should all be more honest with each other.

E	00:13:42.255	00:13:43.670	i thought you'd gone jogging.
A	00:13:44.612	00:13:45.812	i've given that up.
A	00:13:46.407	00:13:47.950	i never really enjoyed it.
E	00:13:48.061	00:13:49.490	no london marathon, then?
A	00:13:49.587	00:13:53.261	no,i thought i'd just read the paper and maybe do the crossword.
A	00:13:53.877	00:13:55.275	could you pass me that pen?
A	00:13:59.541	00:14:00.510	thanks.

B	00:14:09.585	00:14:11.740	julia, will you marry me?
E	00:14:12.581	00:14:13.225	i can't.
E	00:14:13.329	00:14:14.450	i'm editing the news.
E	00:14:19.411	00:14:19.951	tim!
E	00:14:21.089	00:14:21.816	tim!

I	00:14:55.207	00:14:56.245	how was isobel?
B	00:14:59.196	00:15:00.154	sorry.
I	00:15:01.486	00:15:03.448	stop playing games, tim.
I	00:15:03.836	00:15:06.500	i've been in this business far too long for that.
I	00:15:07.019	00:15:09.455	isoble mendoza and i go way back.
I	00:15:09.897	00:15:14.938	she's on the board of directors of kangaroo tv and she was at the amsterdam conference.
B	00:15:17.070	00:15:17.644	ok.
B	00:15:19.101	00:15:23.972	i got a letter from kangaroo tv a couple of days ago offering me a job.
B	00:15:26.384	00:15:28.525	telling julia isn't going to be easy.
I	00:15:29.878	00:15:31.608	well, delaying it won't make it any easier.
B	00:15:32.117	00:15:32.933	i know.
B	00:15:33.836	00:15:36.116	i've decided to tell her as soon as i see her.
B	00:15:36.777	00:15:38.497	but she's been away for the past few days.
I	00:15:39.445	00:15:40.434	oh, yes.
I	00:15:40.503	00:15:45.520	she's doing this series with zoe pearce about ghosts and ufos and things, isn't she?
B	00:15:46.112	00:15:48.551	yes, but she's coming back tonight.
I	00:15:49.987	00:15:53.256	going off to work in australia is a big step, Tim.
I	00:15:54.540	00:15:58.249	so think about it carefully for your sake and julia's.

K	00:16:00.173	00:16:01.394	and cut!
K	00:16:02.806	00:16:04.584	thank you dr akroyd,that was great.
L	00:16:04.515	00:16:04.875	okay.
K	00:16:04.923	00:16:05.328	thank you.
E	00:16:05.760	00:16:07.736	right,that just about wraps it up for this week.
E	00:16:08.037	00:16:09.608	we can pack up now and head off.
K	00:16:09.646	00:16:10.096	thanks, ian.
L	00:16:10.289	00:16:10.808	thanks.
E	00:16:12.144	00:16:14.178	That's a weird story, wasn't it?
K	00:16:14.009	00:16:15.510	it's very strange.
K	00:16:15.894	00:16:18.600	although i don't believe in premonitions.
E	00:16:18.621	00:16:19.769	no, nor do i.

B	00:16:24.444	00:16:26.924	julia, will you marry me?
E	00:16:27.347	00:16:29.516	i can't, i'm editing the news.

K	00:16:33.633	00:16:35.339	do you still want me to drop you off at home?
E	00:16:35.626	00:16:36.678	no, you needn't bother.
E	00:16:36.854	00:16:38.764	we finished a lot earlier than i expected.
E	00:16:39.024	00:16:40.318	i'll call in at the office.
E	00:16:40.487	00:16:42.999	there are a few things i want to sort out for next week's shoot.
K	00:16:43.629	00:16:45.802	you're really enjoying your new job, aren't you?
E	00:16:46.134	00:16:46.850	i love it.

B	00:16:52.676	00:16:55.130	oh, i've left my mobile upstairs.
B	00:16:55.821	00:16:56.631	just a minute.
E	00:16:59.790	00:17:01.070	hi, sean ted.
E	00:17:02.104	00:17:03.575	can you hold the lift?
E	00:17:05.388	00:17:06.152	thank you.
B	00:17:14.166	00:17:15.214	ok, let's go.

H	00:17:23.064	00:17:26.735	tim, what's this i hear about you going to australia.
B	00:17:28.140	00:17:29.420	how did you know about that?
H	00:17:29.562	00:17:30.548	gary, told me.
B	00:17:30.648	00:17:33.001	gary, oh no.
B	00:17:33.679	00:17:35.513	that means everyone the whole place will know by now.
B	00:17:36.464	00:17:38.315	it's a good job julia isn't there today.
H	00:17:38.568	00:17:39.381	she is.
H	00:17:39.845	00:17:41.710	she came in while you were getting your mobile.
B	00:17:42.225	00:17:43.090	what?

B	00:18:00.614	00:18:01.683	you see julia?
M	00:18:01.815	00:18:02.496	no i haven't.
N	00:18:02.576	00:18:04.316	Nor have I,she might be in the edit suite.

B	00:18:19.197	00:18:20.789	i've been looking for you everywhere.
B	00:18:22.235	00:18:23.321	you know, don't you?
E	00:18:24.045	00:18:25.640	why didn't you tell me?
B	00:18:26.082	00:18:28.442	i didn't want to say anything until it was definite.
E	00:18:30.328	00:18:31.438	so what are you going to do?
B	00:18:32.905	00:18:36.151	i'm going to tell them that i can only take the job if my wife agrees.
E	00:18:37.493	00:18:38.680	your wife?
B	00:18:39.915	00:18:43.243	yes, julia, will you marry me?

A	00:18:52.156	00:18:53.135	he did what?
E	00:18:53.149	00:18:55.100	tim, asked me to marry him.
A	00:18:55.761	00:18:57.266	congratulations!
A	00:18:58.245	00:18:59.280	when's the day?
A	00:19:03.262	00:19:04.508	you didn't say yes then.
E	00:19:04.729	00:19:05.646	no, i didn't.
E	00:19:06.092	00:19:08.846	i told him not to be silly, but he said he was serious.
A	00:19:09.538	00:19:10.760	what did you say?
E	00:19:10.891	00:19:13.047	i said that i would have to think about it.
A	00:19:13.694	00:19:15.815	and have you thought about it, that is?
E	00:19:16.468	00:19:18.517	i've thought about nothing else since.
E	00:19:19.440	00:19:26.135	i would like to marry tim and i wouldn't mind living in australia but well i'm really enjoying my new job.
E	00:19:26.063	00:19:30.765	and it's sort of like tim wants to go to australia so my job isn't important.
E	00:19:31.412	00:19:34.231	i just have to give it up to let him do what he wants to do.
A	00:19:35.944	00:19:38.612	you have to decide what you're going to do soon though, won't you?
E	00:19:38.992	00:19:42.912	well luckily i'm going away tomorrow night,i won't be back for the next few days.
E	00:19:43.850	00:19:45.708	so i've got a bit of time to think about it.

B	00:19:55.707	00:20:01.790	it in the nineteensixty experts predicted that by the beginning of the twenty-first century work would be a thing of the past.
B	00:20:02.125	00:20:04.163	but what effect is this having on our health.
B	00:20:04.619	00:20:08.823	and with parents spending more time at work what is it doing to family life.
B	00:20:09.238	00:20:14.140	it's nearly midnight and i'm going to ask some of the customers and workers here what they think.
B	00:20:15.016	00:20:15.951	And cut.
H	00:20:21.133	00:20:23.240	i don't know about other people working long hours.
H	00:20:23.614	00:20:25.361	i've hardly been home in the past week.
B	00:20:26.033	00:20:27.129	you've got tomorrow off.
H	00:20:27.216	00:20:28.717	yeah, but i'm not looking forward to it.
H	00:20:30.174	00:20:33.035	we're going to see a child psychologist about jason and kylie.
H	00:20:34.001	00:20:35.821	it's because of the incident with the digger.
B	00:20:36.616	00:20:37.651	oh, yes.
B	00:20:37.997	00:20:40.613	you said that they'd backed it into the news agent's window.
H	00:20:40.716	00:20:42.934	that was after they'd driven it through someone's garden.
H	00:20:43.982	00:20:46.311	why on earth the workmen left the keys in it, i'll never know.
B	00:20:46.941	00:20:49.158	so where does the child psychologist come into this?
H	00:20:49.622	00:20:55.151	well, the police said that jason and kylie would be in serious trouble if we didn't do something about them.

B	00:21:15.959	00:21:17.107	hello, tim burns.
E	00:21:17.201	00:21:18.453	hi, tim, it's me.
B	00:21:19.425	00:21:22.159	hi, are you all right?
B	00:21:22.283	00:21:23.487	it's two o'clock in the morning.
E	00:21:23.850	00:21:25.234	i couldn't sleep.
E	00:21:25.933	00:21:27.307	i didn't wake you up, did i?
B	00:21:29.078	00:21:31.542	no, we've been working late.
E	00:21:32.535	00:21:37.559	i was going to wait till i got back but well i thought about, you know.
B	00:21:38.852	00:21:39.569	getting married?
E	00:21:39.873	00:21:40.434	yes.
B	00:21:42.260	00:21:43.163	and?

A	00:21:46.232	00:21:47.298	hi, tim.
A	00:21:47.751	00:21:50.962	have you spoken to julia lately,her mobile doesn't seem to be working.
B	00:21:51.318	00:21:53.436	she phoned me from her hotel the other night.
B	00:21:54.560	00:21:57.204	she told me that she wanted to marry me but she wasn't going to.
B	00:21:58.320	00:22:03.476	she said that i'd only asked her to marry me to get myself out of a difficult situation.
A	00:22:03.850	00:22:06.137	she's very upset about it all, you know.
B	00:22:06.234	00:22:11.344	well, she told me that i was going to have to choose australia or her.
A	00:22:12.358	00:22:13.759	oh, hi sean.
A	00:22:15.513	00:22:17.773	didn't it go very well with the psychologist?
H	00:22:19.935	00:22:24.063	he told me that kylie and jason weren't the problem, i was.
H	00:22:25.367	00:22:27.294	He said i didn't spend enough time with them.
H	00:22:28.522	00:22:30.501	but i said it was difficult with my job.
A	00:22:30.802	00:22:32.826	you do work pretty unsocial hours.
H	00:22:33.290	00:22:34.262	he asked me what i did.
H	00:22:34.539	00:22:35.497	so i told him.
B	00:22:35.660	00:22:37.895	did you tell him that you enjoyed your job, too?
B	00:22:38.006	00:22:43.853	yeah, but he asked me which was more important my family or my job.
H	00:22:45.832	00:22:47.946	he said i had to decide what my priorities were.

G	00:23:30.617	00:23:31.350	hello, tim.
B	00:23:32.326	00:23:32.956	simon!
B	00:23:33.364	00:23:34.495	i thought you were in rome.
G	00:23:34.641	00:23:36.637	i was but i had to come back early.
G	00:23:36.948	00:23:38.851	martha wants to talk to me in person.
G	00:23:39.436	00:23:42.079	and apparently frederick's going to be there too.
B	00:23:42.370	00:23:44.435	our managing director is actually here.
B	00:23:44.802	00:23:46.235	It must be something important.
C	00:23:49.674	00:23:51.037	are you coming to the pub for lunch?
B	00:23:51.483	00:23:53.213	um, i'll see you there.
B	00:23:53.504	00:23:54.960	i just want to send this e-mail.
C	00:23:55.431	00:23:56.424	australia.
B	00:23:56.804	00:23:58.092	mind your own business.

B	00:24:02.420	00:24:03.288	is martha free yet?
A	00:24:03.721	00:24:05.914	no, she's still with simon and frederick.
B	00:24:06.468	00:24:08.139	they've been in there all afternoon.
A	00:24:09.056	00:24:11.540	martha's free first thing tomorrow morning.
B	00:24:12.042	00:24:12.561	it's ok.
B	00:24:12.741	00:24:13.374	i'll wait.
A	00:24:16.121	00:24:17.622	sean was here earlier.
A	00:24:18.574	00:24:22.300	he told me he'd decided to ask for a transfer to studio work.
B	00:24:22.584	00:24:23.138	what?
B	00:24:24.255	00:24:25.757	he hates working indoors.
A	00:24:26.539	00:24:28.801	he said it was because the hours were more regular.
A	00:24:29.217	00:24:33.254	and if you were going to australia it was an appropriate time for a change.
A	00:24:38.406	00:24:39.721	he's here now actually.
A	00:24:41.880	00:24:42.409	ok.
A	00:24:44.115	00:24:47.280	martha's just asked me to find you,she wants you to go in and join them.
B	00:24:48.173	00:24:48.841	really?
B	00:24:53.878	00:24:55.598	is this because of sean's family?
A	00:24:56.394	00:25:01.812	yes, he said he'd realized that the people he loved were more important than his job.
A	00:25:04.379	00:25:07.216	he said it was all a question of priorities.

K	00:25:24.813	00:25:26.882	oh that was a bit of a marathon.
E	00:25:26.813	00:25:28.259	And we didn't see the ghost!
K	00:25:28.342	00:25:30.467	i would have run a mile if it had appeared.
K	00:25:31.044	00:25:32.525	i'm exhausted!
E	00:25:32.733	00:25:35.016	perhaps you shouldn't have tried to do it all in one day.
K	00:25:35.044	00:25:37.867	maybe, anyway i don't fancy driving back tonight.
K	00:25:37.864	00:25:40.998	why don't we stay somewhere near here and then we can go straight into work tomorrow.
E	00:25:41.081	00:25:43.842	ok, i'll ring around some of the local hotels.
E	00:25:44.451	00:25:46.475	can i borrow your mobile,mine's not working.
K	00:25:46.500	00:25:47.468	yes, of course.
K	00:25:48.330	00:25:48.908	Here you are.

B	00:25:56.592	00:25:57.184	hi, rebecca.
B	00:25:57.554	00:25:58.547	is julia back yet?
B	00:26:00.374	00:26:01.131	and she hasn't called.
B	00:26:03.131	00:26:05.252	well, when you speak to her, could you get her to call me?
B	00:26:06.183	00:26:07.238	i don't mind how late.

O	00:27:10.249	00:27:11.751	well, good morning, zoe, julia.
K	00:27:11.945	00:27:12.567	morning, ted.
E	00:27:12.595	00:27:12.941	morning.
O	00:27:12.969	00:27:16.256	although you've got a package for you here and you need a sign for it.
P	00:27:17.377	00:27:20.051	well i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't heard it from martha.
E	00:27:20.311	00:27:21.144	see you later, zoe.
K	00:27:21.193	00:27:21.577	ok.
Q	00:27:21.919	00:27:23.487	so he's definitely going to australia.
P	00:27:23.511	00:27:25.102	yes, to kangaroo tv.
K	00:27:30.171	00:27:30.815	julia?
K	00:27:41.360	00:27:42.090	Julia!

B	00:28:03.856	00:28:05.012	hello, tim burns.
B	00:28:06.905	00:28:07.251	what?
B	00:28:09.455	00:28:10.188	is she all right?
B	00:28:12.399	00:28:15.090	the general, yeah, i'm on my way.
B	00:28:18.858	00:28:20.751	julia, if you're right what happened?
R	00:28:21.692	00:28:24.055	you may well ask, tim barnes.
R	00:28:24.854	00:28:26.328	this is all your fault.
R	00:28:27.176	00:28:30.459	if you hadn't decided to go off to australia, this wouldn't have happened.
B	00:28:30.837	00:28:32.947	but...you should have told me, tim.
B	00:28:33.296	00:28:35.293	could somebody please tell me what's going on?
E	00:28:36.116	00:28:40.725	i was in reception and i heard abigail saying that you were definitely going to australia.
B	00:28:43.091	00:28:45.070	she said that i was going to australia?
E	00:28:45.572	00:28:48.247	well, she didn't actually mention your name, but...
S	00:28:48.921	00:28:50.651	i don't think it's very funny.
S	00:28:51.509	00:28:54.395	if that driver hadn't stopped so quickly julia would have been killed.
B	00:28:55.301	00:28:57.087	she wasn't talking about me.
B	00:28:57.107	00:28:59.024	she was talking about frederick.
B	00:28:59.581	00:29:01.045	i'm not going to australia.
E	00:29:14.964	00:29:16.185	let me get this straight.

E	00:29:16.842	00:29:22.070	frederick's going to be managing director of kangaroo tv and martha's taking over.
B	00:29:22.499	00:29:28.250	then simon fletcher is taking martha's place and they've offered me simon's old job as foreign reporter.
B	00:29:28.796	00:29:30.900	so as soon as you're well again we can get married.
E	00:29:31.547	00:29:33.979	but nothing's really changed has it, tim?
B	00:29:34.647	00:29:35.187	what do you mean?
E	00:29:35.789	00:29:39.235	you wouldn't have asked me to marry you if you hadn't been offered the job in australia.
E	00:29:39.937	00:29:42.916	and you would have gone, if simon's job hadn't come up.
B	00:29:43.407	00:29:46.314	no, i'd already turned the australian job down.
E	00:29:46.400	00:29:47.877	i don't believe you.
C	00:29:49.943	00:29:51.389	how's the patient?
B	00:29:52.967	00:29:54.192	look, i'll show you.
B	00:29:55.825	00:29:57.980	oh, no, i put it under your door.
A	00:29:59.098	00:30:01.111	is this what you want?
C	00:30:10.751	00:30:12.076	you really turned it down?
B	00:30:12.775	00:30:16.186	i emailed that yesterday before i knew anything about the job at apex.
C	00:30:17.608	00:30:19.407	it's true, julia,i saw him typing it.

E	00:30:38.385	00:30:41.620	It must be nice being a foreign reporter going to all those different places.
B	00:30:41.896	00:30:42.561	it is.
B	00:30:42.882	00:30:44.377	i'm off to barbados today.
E	00:30:44.464	00:30:45.266	oh, really?
E	00:30:45.464	00:30:46.367	so am i.
E	00:30:46.913	00:30:48.678	i'm staying at the honeymoon hotel.
E	00:30:49.249	00:30:51.186	perhaps i'll see you there, mr barnes.
B	00:30:51.335	00:30:53.878	perhaps you will, mrs barnes.
