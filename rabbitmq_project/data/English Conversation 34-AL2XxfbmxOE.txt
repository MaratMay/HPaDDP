A	00:00:15.200	00:00:16.480	was your flight okay?
B	00:00:16.480	00:00:18.000	no, pretty bad, actually.
B	00:00:18.000	00:00:19.249	it was so bumpy.
B	00:00:19.029	00:00:20.880	it was very scary.
A	00:00:20.880	00:00:22.560	that's too bad.
A	00:00:22.560	00:00:24.870	did you have nice weather after you arrive?
B	00:00:24.880	00:00:26.720	no, the weather was terrible.
B	00:00:26.720	00:00:27.519	very rainy.
B	00:00:27.519	00:00:30.390	i actually never saw the sun.
A	00:00:30.400	00:00:32.160	that's awful!
A	00:00:32.160	00:00:33.430	so what did you do?
B	00:00:33.440	00:00:35.280	i stayed inside the hotel.
A	00:00:35.280	00:00:37.270	was the hotel room nice?
B	00:00:37.280	00:00:40.660	the room was fine, but it was right next to the caf? 
B	00:00:40.705	00:00:43.512	and the music was very loud,i didn't sleep much.
A	00:00:44.079	00:00:46.155	i'll bet the food was great.
B	00:00:46.105	00:00:46.806	no.
B	00:00:46.836	00:00:50.219	it was too salty for me, and the waiters were very unfriendly.
A	00:00:50.559	00:00:52.480	did you go shopping at all?
B	00:00:52.480	00:00:55.189	a little bit until someone stole my wallet.
B	00:00:55.199	00:00:58.549	after that i stayed in the hotel and read the book.
A	00:00:58.559	00:01:00.640	was the flight home okay?
B	00:01:00.640	00:01:02.869	actually, they cancelled my flight.
B	00:01:02.879	00:01:04.768	i had to stay for two more days.
A	00:01:05.519	00:01:07.680	that's terrible!
A	00:01:07.680	00:01:12.640	but mr rasheed, you said that your vacation was wonderful.

B	00:01:13.520	00:01:15.119	and it was wonderful.
B	00:01:15.119	00:01:17.840	i met a very nice person a woman actually.
B	00:01:17.840	00:01:19.119	her name is basma.
B	00:01:19.119	00:01:20.363	she's from lebanon.
B	00:01:20.240	00:01:22.640	just like me, but she lives here.
B	00:01:22.640	00:01:24.092	i'm seeing her tonight.
B	00:01:24.162	00:01:26.960	so, yes, it was a wonderful vacation.
A	00:01:26.960	00:01:29.280	that's great, mr rasheed.

D	00:01:46.880	00:01:48.960	oh.
D	00:01:48.960	00:01:53.670	you know, on my vacation last year someone stole my car.
D	00:01:53.680	00:01:56.399	that was a horrible vacation.
A	00:01:56.399	00:02:00.550	i went on a cruise and there was an outbreak of illness.
D	00:02:00.560	00:02:02.960	i was in my room for a week.
A	00:02:02.960	00:02:05.109	that was a really bad vacation.
E	00:02:05.119	00:02:08.270	i went to disney world and someone stole my map.
A	00:02:09.599	00:02:11.798	that's your worst vacation?
E	00:02:12.319	00:02:14.949	it took ten minutes to get another map.
D	00:02:14.959	00:02:18.400	all right, what was your favorite vacation?
A	00:02:18.400	00:02:24.879	i spent two weeks in the caribbean last year, diving, snorkeling, and swimming with dolphins.
A	00:02:24.879	00:02:26.480	it was amazing.
D	00:02:26.480	00:02:29.510	i went to china a few years ago.
D	00:02:29.520	00:02:30.879	it was incredible.
D	00:02:30.879	00:02:36.470	the people there were so friendly, and everyone wanted to practice their english with me.
E	00:02:36.480	00:02:39.816	i went to the beach and ate shrimp.
A	00:02:41.519	00:02:43.244	that's your best vacation?
E	00:02:43.840	00:02:45.816	i really like shrimp.
A	00:02:47.040	00:02:50.000	you need to go on more exciting vacations.
E	00:02:50.000	00:02:52.319	i don't like exciting vacations.
E	00:02:52.319	00:02:55.030	in fact, i don't like to travel very much.
A	00:02:55.040	00:02:58.959	then why do you work in a travel agency?
E	00:02:58.959	00:03:03.740	it's across the street from my apartment, so i don't have to travel far to go to work.
F	00:03:15.040	00:03:16.879	that is so cute.
D	00:03:16.879	00:03:19.654	thank you,i love that color.

E	00:03:46.000	00:03:47.767	all those clothes are for one party?
D	00:03:48.480	00:03:51.520	no, we have to decide what to wear.
D	00:03:52.799	00:03:54.924	what do you think of these blouses?
E	00:03:55.940	00:03:57.271	they're very flattering.
F	00:03:58.080	00:04:00.079	which one do you like more?

F	00:04:13.040	00:04:14.480	you need to have an opinion.
F	00:04:14.480	00:04:16.000	you have to choose.
E	00:04:16.000	00:04:17.430	no, no, no.
E	00:04:17.440	00:04:19.440	i'm not doing that.
D	00:04:19.440	00:04:22.000	bob, please.

E	00:05:02.080	00:05:02.970	no,i don't.
E	00:05:04.000	00:05:05.057	that's not true.
D	00:05:10.960	00:05:13.390	then which dress do you prefer?
E	00:05:14.400	00:05:15.007	that one.
D	00:05:16.639	00:05:18.595	this is marie's dress, too!
D	00:05:19.600	00:05:21.038	what's wrong with my clothes?
E	00:05:21.043	00:05:21.633	nothing!
E	00:05:22.160	00:05:22.849	nothing!
E	00:05:22.720	00:05:24.560	i like your clothes.
E	00:05:24.560	00:05:25.919	i like marie's clothes.
E	00:05:25.919	00:05:27.199	i like everything.
E	00:05:27.199	00:05:32.910	i like all dresses and all sweaters and all skirts and all shoes!
D	00:05:34.160	00:05:35.842	who asked you anyway?
D	00:05:44.479	00:05:47.829	so what are you going to wear to the party tomorrow night?
E	00:05:49.520	00:05:52.320	a t-shirt and jeans.
D	00:05:52.320	00:05:54.710	a t-shirt and jeans?
D	00:05:54.720	00:05:55.840	no way.
D	00:05:55.840	00:05:58.230	you have to wear something nicer.
E	00:05:58.240	00:06:00.226	i don't have anything nicer.
D	00:06:04.080	00:06:05.440	you do now.
E	00:06:05.440	00:06:06.607	all that's for me?
D	00:06:08.880	00:06:11.597	what do you think of these?
E	00:06:13.199	00:06:14.675	do you have anything looser?
D	00:06:15.576	00:06:16.467	yep.
E	00:06:22.880	00:06:24.880	too wild for me.
E	00:06:24.880	00:06:25.886	anything else?
D	00:06:29.360	00:06:31.000	here you go.
E	00:06:31.280	00:06:32.457	i don't know.
E	00:06:34.400	00:06:37.039	those look pretty warm.
E	00:06:37.039	00:06:38.563	something cooler would be good.
D	00:06:39.919	00:06:41.371	why don't we look at shirts?
E	00:06:44.960	00:06:45.805	not bad.
E	00:06:47.440	00:06:50.645	but it's pretty conservative, isn't it?
D	00:06:53.759	00:06:56.629	i love this one.
E	00:06:58.639	00:07:00.645	that doesn't look very comfortable.
D	00:07:05.280	00:07:06.390	try this.
E	00:07:08.400	00:07:09.764	that looks a little cheap.
E	00:07:10.960	00:07:12.802	do you have anything more expensive?
D	00:07:14.400	00:07:15.280	that's it.
D	00:07:15.280	00:07:17.520	i'm taking it all back to the store.
E	00:07:17.520	00:07:19.479	but what am i wearing tomorrow?
D	00:07:20.479	00:07:23.557	just wear a t-shirt and jeans.
D	00:07:34.319	00:07:39.029	so, mrs beatty, we should talk about your safari trip to botswana.
G	00:07:39.039	00:07:40.560	i'm so excited!
G	00:07:40.560	00:07:42.035	my first time in africa!
D	00:07:42.639	00:07:46.629	you're going to be flying into johannesburg, south africa.
D	00:07:46.639	00:07:48.960	would you like a window or an aisle?
G	00:07:48.960	00:07:50.080	a window.
G	00:07:50.080	00:07:51.919	i want to see everything!
D	00:07:51.919	00:07:56.479	in johannesburg you should take a taxi or a limo to your hotel.
D	00:07:56.479	00:08:02.950	the next day you could fly or you could take a train to francis town in botswana.
G	00:08:04.160	00:08:06.080	is it an express train?
D	00:08:06.080	00:08:07.039	yes.
G	00:08:07.039	00:08:08.400	i'll take the train.
G	00:08:08.400	00:08:09.919	i'd like to see the country.
D	00:08:09.919	00:08:11.199	great.
D	00:08:11.199	00:08:18.950	then after you see francis town, you can take a small plane or a bus to the okavanga delta.
G	00:08:18.960	00:08:20.800	how small is the airplane?
D	00:08:20.800	00:08:23.520	it's pretty small.
G	00:08:23.520	00:08:25.039	i'll take the bus.
G	00:08:25.039	00:08:26.950	is it an express bus?'
D	00:08:26.960	00:08:28.800	i think so.
D	00:08:28.800	00:08:34.159	when you get to gumare you're going to be taking a boat to your hotel.
G	00:08:34.159	00:08:35.200	a boat?
D	00:08:35.200	00:08:43.440	the hotel is on an island when you get to the island, a man with a donkey can take your luggage to the hotel.
G	00:08:44.320	00:08:45.217	a donkey?
D	00:08:45.920	00:08:47.734	there are no cars on the island.
G	00:08:48.399	00:08:50.171	is it an express donkey?
D	00:08:51.040	00:08:54.420	i think it's probably a local donkey.
D	00:08:55.120	00:09:02.230	of course, if you don't want the donkey, you could take a small plane it goes straight to the hotel.
G	00:09:02.240	00:09:04.480	i think i should take the donkey.
G	00:09:04.480	00:09:07.123	donkeys never have mechanical problems, right?
D	00:09:08.080	00:09:08.980	right.

H	00:09:17.680	00:09:19.590	hello, mrs beatty!

H	00:09:34.959	00:09:36.461	i did that once myself.
D	00:09:36.496	00:09:37.087	you did?
G	00:09:37.092	00:09:38.133	was it very exciting?
H	00:09:38.080	00:09:39.279	oh, it was.
H	00:09:39.279	00:09:42.470	on the way there the plane had mechanical problems.
G	00:09:42.480	00:09:43.839	that sounds scary.
H	00:09:43.839	00:09:49.509	we got in late and i missed the train to francis town so i decided to take a bus.
H	00:09:49.519	00:09:52.949	but i got on the local bus by mistake.
G	00:09:52.959	00:09:55.360	i don't like local buses.
H	00:09:55.360	00:09:57.509	then the bus had an accident.
H	00:09:57.519	00:10:00.790	so i rented a car but it broke down.
G	00:10:00.800	00:10:01.920	oh, dear!
H	00:10:01.920	00:10:04.550	i got to gomari two days late.
H	00:10:04.560	00:10:07.200	then i got seasick on the boat to the island.

G	00:10:08.800	00:10:11.120	did you have any problems with the donkey?
H	00:10:11.120	00:10:12.912	i got bumped from the donkey.
G	00:10:13.440	00:10:16.000	you mean they overbooked the donkey?
H	00:10:16.000	00:10:16.550	no.
H	00:10:16.560	00:10:20.179	i mean the donkey bumped me off the road to the hotel.
H	00:10:24.399	00:10:26.480	but it was a very exciting trip.
H	00:10:26.480	00:10:28.399	you'll love africa.
D	00:10:28.399	00:10:29.279	so.
