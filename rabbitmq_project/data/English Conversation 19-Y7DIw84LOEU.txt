A	00:16:24.320	00:16:27.027	Of course, betty is jealous.
A	00:16:28.320	00:16:33.600	She says i spend too much money on clothes.
C	00:16:33.600	00:16:35.350	Hi girls.

B	00:17:29.600	00:17:30.960	I don't know it.
C	00:17:30.960	00:17:33.639	Agatha watches it a lot.
C	00:17:34.400	00:17:36.470	Betty has the video.
B	00:17:37.520	00:17:39.770	I would like to see the movie, too.
A	00:17:40.080	00:17:41.348	You will love it!

B	00:17:53.200	00:17:54.569	Do you like it, victor?
C	00:17:55.360	00:17:58.320	It's a bit old for me.
C	00:17:58.320	00:18:01.150	I prefer science fiction and fantasy stories.

B	00:18:17.360	00:18:18.960	This is my coat.
A	00:18:19.679	00:18:21.990	You will die of cold in that coat!
C	00:18:22.000	00:18:26.320	You will really need a warmer coat soon, Elena.
A	00:18:26.320	00:18:29.601	It gets very cold in London.
A	00:18:29.760	00:18:32.470	Not like sunny Barcelona.
