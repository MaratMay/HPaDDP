B	00:28:01.400	00:28:09.320	well, the one bin washer is more expensive but it's simple to use.
F	00:28:09.320	00:28:11.690	simple is important.
F	00:28:11.690	00:28:16.040	well, I think I'd like the one bin washer.

B	00:28:37.830	00:28:41.502	you put in the soap and the washer does the rest.
F	00:28:42.251	00:28:43.307	sounds perfect.

J	00:34:05.309	00:34:07.239	honey! I'm home.
K	00:34:11.249	00:34:13.620	how are you?
J	00:34:13.620	00:34:15.460	I'm terrible.
J	00:34:15.460	00:34:17.130	I have a headache.
K	00:34:17.130	00:34:19.110	I'm so sad to hear that.
K	00:34:19.110	00:34:21.180	what gives you a headache?
J	00:34:21.180	00:34:25.200	there are so many reasons.
K	00:34:25.200	00:34:27.670	maybe you'll feel better if you tell me.
J	00:34:28.170	00:34:32.569	well, work is my biggest headache.
K	00:34:32.579	00:34:34.430	what is wrong at work?
J	00:34:35.430	00:34:37.499	it's my boss.
J	00:34:37.509	00:34:40.140	he always scolds me.
K	00:34:40.140	00:34:42.799	why does your boss scold you?
J	00:34:42.809	00:34:47.730	he says I'm lazy and I take too many breaks.
K	00:34:47.730	00:34:50.279	well do you take too many breaks?
J	00:34:50.289	00:34:53.789	I don't think so.
K	00:34:53.789	00:34:56.019	well why don't you ignore your boss?
J	00:34:56.019	00:34:59.499	I can't ignore him.
J	00:34:59.499	00:35:02.210	he's my boss.
K	00:35:02.220	00:35:03.960	that's too bad.
K	00:35:03.960	00:35:05.970	what else gives you a headache?
J	00:35:05.970	00:35:09.710	what else gives me a headache?
J	00:35:09.720	00:35:11.560	my co-workers!
J	00:35:11.560	00:35:13.890	my co-workers give me a headache.
K	00:35:13.890	00:35:16.920	why do your co-workers give you a headache?
J	00:35:16.920	00:35:19.890	because they're always gossiping.
K	00:35:19.890	00:35:23.090	do they gossip about you?
J	00:35:23.100	00:35:26.700	probably but not to my face.
K	00:35:26.700	00:35:28.380	that's too bad.
K	00:35:28.380	00:35:31.110	what else gives you a headache?
J	00:35:33.120	00:35:34.120	driving.
J	00:35:34.120	00:35:36.410	driving gives me a headache.
K	00:35:36.420	00:35:38.590	why does driving give you a headache?
J	00:35:38.590	00:35:47.100	oh. there's always traffic jams and there's no place to park.
K	00:35:47.100	00:35:50.220	why don't you take a bus to work?
J	00:35:50.220	00:35:52.560	take a bus to work?
J	00:35:52.560	00:35:56.970	it's too crowded and there's never a seat.
K	00:35:56.970	00:35:59.100	that's too bad.
K	00:35:59.100	00:36:02.519	what can you do to get rid of your headache?
J	00:36:02.519	00:36:06.830	easy. I come home and I see you!

J	00:36:15.620	00:36:18.180	are you excited to go to the party?
K	00:36:18.180	00:36:21.170	yes. I am very excited about the party.
J	00:36:21.170	00:36:24.130	do you think we should bring something with us?
K	00:36:24.140	00:36:27.350	yes. I think we should bring a gift or something.
J	00:36:27.350	00:36:29.770	what would be good to bring?
K	00:36:29.780	00:36:31.600	what about bringing flowers?
J	00:36:32.660	00:36:35.719	but the flower shop is so far away.
J	00:36:35.719	00:36:38.150	can you think of something else?
K	00:36:38.150	00:36:41.420	what if we bring some chips.
J	00:36:41.420	00:36:43.969	someone else will be bringing chips.
J	00:36:43.969	00:36:46.570	can you think of something else?
K	00:36:46.580	00:36:49.489	what about bringing food?
J	00:36:49.489	00:36:52.019	well, we don't have to bring food.
J	00:36:52.019	00:36:56.390	because there's gonna be a buffer at the party.
K	00:36:56.390	00:37:00.739	what about bringing my music CD collection?
J	00:37:00.739	00:37:04.370	bringing your music CD collection is a good idea!
J	00:37:04.370	00:37:08.320	but they're gonna have a DJ at the party.
K	00:37:08.330	00:37:11.979	what about bringing some playing cards?
J	00:37:11.989	00:37:14.570	you don't have to bring playing cards.
J	00:37:14.580	00:37:18.800	because there's going to be a mini casino at the party.
K	00:37:18.800	00:37:19.800	really?
K	00:37:19.800	00:37:22.590	there's going to be a mini casino at the party?
J	00:37:22.590	00:37:25.850	really! it's true I'm not kidding.
J	00:37:25.850	00:37:29.239	can you think of something else?
K	00:37:31.249	00:37:34.999	there's only one thing the party does not have.
J	00:37:34.999	00:37:37.040	what's that?
K	00:37:37.040	00:37:39.650	the party does not have us.
K	00:37:39.650	00:37:41.810	let's just bring ourselves.
J	00:37:41.810	00:37:43.729	yeah!
