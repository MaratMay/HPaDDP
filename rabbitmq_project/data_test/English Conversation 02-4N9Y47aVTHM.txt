A	00:11:31.937	00:11:33.793	I know that shop.
B	00:11:33.984	00:11:34.713	where is it?
D	00:11:35.089	00:11:36.974	it's on the third floor at the mall.
A	00:11:37.209	00:11:37.946	ok.
D	00:11:39.220	00:11:41.870	well, I'm sorry but I have to go now.

A	00:11:48.652	00:11:49.138	bye.

B	00:11:55.323	00:11:56.280	hey, al.
B	00:11:56.442	00:11:57.443	where is your car?
A	00:11:58.776	00:12:00.646	I took it to the repair shop.
B	00:12:01.670	00:12:03.503	oh, did you have an accident?
A	00:12:04.394	00:12:07.811	no, I left it with the mechanics for a tune-up.
B	00:12:08.407	00:12:09.475	when will it be ready?
A	00:12:10.366	00:12:13.142	the mechanic said it will be ready on Monday.
B	00:12:14.158	00:12:15.888	that's such a long time.
A	00:12:16.602	00:12:18.509	yeah,it is a long time.
B	00:12:19.187	00:12:21.013	are you planning on going on a trip?
A	00:12:22.213	00:12:27.271	no. I just take it to the mechanics every three thousands kilometers also.
B	00:12:27.993	00:12:29.274	why do you do that?
A	00:12:30.025	00:12:31.203	it's very old.
A	00:12:31.314	00:12:32.735	it needs a lot of care.
B	00:12:33.810	00:12:34.833	how old is your car?
A	00:12:35.643	00:12:38.301	it's a nineteen seventy five model.
B	00:12:38.390	00:12:40.444	huh,that's not so old.
B	00:12:40.606	00:12:42.999	my grandmother was born in nineteen twelve.
A	00:12:44.185	00:12:50.171	well, I guess, compared to your grandmother, my car isn't that old.
B	00:12:51.592	00:12:52.755	hey, wait a minute.
B	00:12:53.823	00:12:55.605	how are we going to get to the movie?
A	00:12:57.335	00:12:59.566	well, we can walk or go by train.
A	00:12:59.795	00:13:00.604	up to you.
B	00:13:01.510	00:13:03.204	are you crazy,walk?
B	00:13:03.513	00:13:05.700	the shopping mall is much too far.
A	00:13:07.239	00:13:09.286	in that case, we'll go by train.

A	00:13:16.921	00:13:19.837	so Bob, do you take the train often?
B	00:13:20.949	00:13:21.884	yes, al.
B	00:13:21.950	00:13:23.320	almost everyday.
A	00:13:24.115	00:13:25.433	almost everyday?
A	00:13:25.536	00:13:26.464	that's a lot.
B	00:13:27.104	00:13:28.467	but I enjoy the train.
B	00:13:28.599	00:13:29.814	it's very convenient.
A	00:13:30.830	00:13:31.353	I see.
B	00:13:33.481	00:13:36.286	and it's the fastest way to travel across town.
A	00:13:37.803	00:13:40.896	are there many people on the train during the rush hour?
B	00:13:41.301	00:13:44.504	well, there are many people in the morning before work.
B	00:13:45.012	00:13:48.023	and there are many people in the evening after work.
A	00:13:49.253	00:13:50.902	what about other times?
B	00:13:51.322	00:13:52.279	at other times?
B	00:13:52.603	00:13:54.429	no,not so many people.
A	00:13:55.173	00:13:58.192	and there is never a traffic jam?
B	00:13:58.332	00:13:59.480	on a train?
B	00:13:59.745	00:14:01.630	there's never any traffic jam.
A	00:14:02.448	00:14:03.287	that's good.
B	00:14:03.611	00:14:05.503	it's the fastest way to travel.
A	00:14:06.394	00:14:09.943	you know, I think it's faster than driving in a car.
B	00:14:10.245	00:14:12.336	and the train is not very expensive.
A	00:14:12.756	00:14:14.339	hey, Bob!
A	00:14:15.849	00:14:17.314	look at that sign.
B	00:14:20.377	00:14:21.577	the University?
B	00:14:22.299	00:14:23.204	oh, oh!
B	00:14:25.472	00:14:27.313	we're waiting for the wrong train.
A	00:14:29.478	00:14:32.909	we're on the wrong platform, teacher?
B	00:14:33.152	00:14:36.841	yes. we're on the wrong platform.
A	00:14:39.425	00:14:41.848	so, now,what do we do?
B	00:14:42.429	00:14:44.609	well, we can take it taxi.
B	00:14:44.727	00:14:45.868	taxi is good.
A	00:14:46.140	00:14:48.121	yes, taxis are good.
A	00:14:48.939	00:14:50.109	let's take a taxi.
A	00:14:50.426	00:14:55.212	and we won't waste our time waiting for the wrong train.

A	00:15:53.661	00:15:56.459	why are these shoes so much cheaper?
E	00:15:57.961	00:15:59.389	because they're made here.
